3329,"The last part of the pictorial will now begin!"" Sebastian announced. Everyone sat back to his or her seats, waiting in anticipation.What is Maya""s secret weapon...?Oh, you""ll see in a few seconds.The curtains opened as the background changed again. It was now a beach.Could it be that..?Yuta was standing on the stage; all spotlights were focused on him. His current attire is what caught the attention of the audience.Bikini.Yup, Kirishima Yuta is wearing a bikini.The bikini was pink in color, simple but it appealed.Different reactions were again heard from the audience. ""Yuta is in a bikini... waaah! He""s soooo cute!"" Mito squealed. ""Is Yuta really a girl...?"" Nina whispered. ""Could I ask how did he achieve his chest?"" Tsujiai mused.""Tsujiai?!"" Kaji and the prince chorused. They looked at their friend disbelievingly. Tsujiai is so suspicious, very suspicious...""It looks so real..."" Ayu suddenly added. ""Yuta looks nice on that bikini,"" Mikami-sensei said thoughtfully. ""Where did he get the bikini?"" Rio asked.""GAK! I now remember why those dresses are familiar,"" Luna suddenly said. They looked at her curiously. ""What do you mean? """"Those clothes, including that bikini, were Maya""s,"" answered Luna. Everyone""s attention turned to Maya.""Maya""s?!"" Everyone except for Sebastian, Luna and Maya chorused.""So?"" Maya said- her tone was not carrying any emotion at all.""So?! They are yours!"" Mikami-sensei blurted out.""So? """"How can you let Yuta wear them?"" Tsujiai rephrased Mikami-sensei""s comment. ""Why not? I do not wear such clothes, for Pete""s sake!"" Maya answered as she flipped her hair. ""Poor clothes..."" Nina said.""Maya-chan!"" Yuta ran to them. ""This bikini is totally amazing! It""s so cute! I""m telling you, you have a very good sense of fashion! """"Not really, Yuka-chan,"" she tuck a loose strand behind his ear. ""Anyway, we should get this done before the Jusenkyo Potion loses its effect,"" she said as she and Yuta made their way to the stage.Nina giggled while Tsujiai had a thoughtful look on his face. It seems Maya is comfortable with gay-type Yuta. Hmm... The theory of putting the two is possible, very possible. ""I wonder how the TRUE Yuta would react when he learns that there was a part in his life where he has done two things no one could imagine he""ll do: first, cross-dressing, second: being cozy with Orihara,"" Kaji mused while Mito giggled like crazy. ""I would love to see his reaction,"" Rio snickered.----------------------------As the sun continued to set, the lone figure suddenly collapsed in the dry road.""I... I.... can""t give up! I WILL NEVER GIVE UP! I""ll find them no matter what! Especially the man I loved...""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To Be Continued...So what do you think? Please review!The person speaking in the last part will be revealed in the upcoming chapters.I may not able to update for a while because of school and my other fanfic in GTO so please be patient with me. (1) Onizuka, Kikuchi, and Kanzaki are all from GTO and I don""t own them.",560480
1225,"""It is a huge body of water."" It was slow yet evident: Cagalli pouted. It was another first for Athrun. ""You""re no fun!"" she mouthed, her voice coming out like an innocent remark from a child. Then, as suddenly as her mood changed, she flashed him an innocent grin and pulled him into the water. Athrun blinked but it wasn""t due to the coldness of the water but solely due to Cagalli""s happiness. It was pure... it was true. It wasn""t the happiness she showed to the media this morning. She was... just being her self. She let go of his arms and ran further into the water that it reached her knees. ""Come and get me, Athrun! And if you can, I""ll treat you to dinner!"" she challenged. Athrun smiled. If this brought her joy, then let it be. ""I accept your challenge!"" he skillfully walked towards her, his hands trying to catch the princess. It was a moment when both felt their childhood coming back to them. Cagalli, who had to mature early in the care of her maids and body guards; and Athrun, whose childhood all shattered having to fight with his best friend and the death of his mother. It was all understandable, that two people who lost a part of themselves tried to regain or even rebuild what they longed for. The term ""too late"" seemed inexistent in their dictionary. Cagalli knew from the start that Athrun will always win in this kind of game. He was a coordinator. But then, it didn""t mean she would easily give up. She ran and ran away from his grasps, her laughter echoing through the air. She tried and tried to pry away from his grasps but then, he caught up. Athrun, with what little strength he had, (mind you, chasing a stubborn princess was definitely tiring, Kisaka would definitely explain it better) caught Cagalli, his arms circled her waist and picked her up. With an excellent flick he managed to position the lady in his arms, bridal-style. It never fails to amaze Cagalli how great Athrun could be. She didn""t even notice how the hell he managed to change her position. But it didn""t matter for she had important things in mind. It was only then that she realized how close Athrun held her as he carried her back to the shore. She knew she was blushing, who wouldn""t be? He gently brought her down her feet when they reached the shore. Cagalli was silent as she tried to calm her beating heart. She was now certain, she couldn""t just throw away her feelings for Athrun. She still loves him... even now... even he couldn""t remember... even if he saw her only as a sister... ""Cagalli, are you alright?"" She blinked as his eyes locked unto her, concerned. ""I""m just... tired..."" It wasn""t purely a lie. She was really tired and so she let herself plop down the sand, just like what she did early in the park. Athrun sat beside her, his hands supported his weight. He turned and smiled to her. ""You""ll treat me dinner, wouldn""t you?"" Cagalli turned her head too quickly that it was just mere inches and their faces would have bumped. ""Ahhh! You beat me now, but next time I""ll surely win!"" she remarked though her voice sounded higher than usual.",560480
3334,"As she reached for the door, the sound of a car horn cut through the evening. They both looked...Winry""s face lit up a bit, then she waved, and called out, ""Russel! Fletcher!"" Ed watched as the parallels of the Tringams drove up and parked in front of Winry""s house. Fletcher, looking the same age as Al, hopped out of the passenger""s seat, beaming, while Russel slowly opened the driver""s side door and waked over. Fletcher ran up the stairs, then threw his arms around Winry""s waist. He might have been a teen, but he was still just a little shorter than Ed. Just how it should be, Ed thought to himself...But dang it if Russel weren""t taller! Even taller than the fourteen year old version he remembered. ""Winry!"" cried Fletcher happily as he hugged her, ""We missed you! How are you doing? How are the nuns? Mother Panaka? We were just at our house. Thanks for taking care of it for us."" Winry laughed, then said, ""Its nothing. You guys are like my brothers."" ""And who""s this?"" Russel asked when he finally made it to the porch. At least I know I""m not invisible, Ed thought, but he said, ""Edward Elric, nice to meet you..."" ""Oh, right,"" Winry said, gently pushing Fletcher off of her, ""He and his brother and a friend arrived today. I offered them dinner...You two want to join? There""s plenty? You""d like Alphonse, Fletcher, he""s about your age."" ""Really?!"" asked Fletcher, ""Everyone else here is too old or too young...Not counting you, of course, Winry,"" he added before bolting into the house. ""Excuse him,"" Russel said to Ed, ""He""s just used to London...I go to University there. I""m home for summer holiday...I""m Russel Tringam, by the way, and that was my baby brother Fletcher."" ""Figured,"" Ed said, shaking Russel""s hand, remembering earlier to put his glove back on over his metal hand. As Russel took his hand from Ed""s he glanced at Winry, then said, ""I hate to be rude, but can you let me and Winry talk privately?"" ""Huh? Why?"" Ed asked. ""Edward, its fine...Besides, that stew will get eaten up if you don""t go on in,"" Winry reminded him. Ed""s stomach did all the talking with a loud growl. Ed just nodded, gave a sheepish grin, and hurried on in to join Noah, his brother, and Fletcher. When Edward was inside, Russel looked at Winry, leaning down a little, ""So,"" he asked, ""How""s my girl?"" ""I""m not your girl, Russel,"" she replied as she put her hands behind her back. She hated this part. Around others, he was a gentleman, but ever since he was fourteen, he""d been flirting and when they were sixteen, he""d promised to go to University and come back to marry her. She""d told him over and over she didn""t feel the same. ""You are...You have been since we were kids,"" he said, leaning in more. ""Russel...stop,"" she said sternly as she backed up against the side of the house. ""Why won""t you accept it?"" he asked softly. He wasn""t menacing, but he was assertive.",512464
3573,"Despite the scowl that seemed to be forever plastered on his face, humanity""s strongest human has emotions buried deep inside of him. Emotions that normal human beings possess. ""It""s amazing to see that you, Corporal Levi, whose heart is as cold as ice, actually cared."" the squad leader teased. Levi was used to her jokes and he always found them annoying. He had nothing else to do but to give her intimidating glares and threats that that would turn into reality. ""Shut up, four-eyes. Now a bet""s a bet. You have to take a freaking bath every day."" Levi muttered as he entered the dining hall. ""Right, right. It""s going to be a looooong month."" Hanji replied, following behind him. That night it was Sasha and Mikasa""s turn for kitchen duty. After enduring the pain of washing the dishes with Sasha, Mikasa found relief that they were about to place their aprons back to the hanger and walk out of the kitchen and rest for the night. It was a long day, and she didn""t even had a chance to talk to Eren. She has to admit, it was mostly on the side that she decided not to talk to Eren yet. ""Hey, Mikasa. It kinda seems like you""re up on the clouds all day. Is it because of Eren?"" Sasha asked as they walked out of the dining hall. Mikasa adjusted the scarf around her neck before answering. ""A little, yes."" she replied. ""Oh come on! That""s what you""ve been waiting for, right? Eren""s feelings to match with yours?"" ""Yeah, but..."" ""Is it because you weren""t mentally prepared, huh?"" Mikasa sighed. She didn""t want to admit it. ""Yes."" she answered meekly. ""Well don""t worry. You guys have known each other for so long. Just go with it! Follow your instincts! That""s the first rule in hunting!"" Sasha happily said, as she playfully marched towards their cabin. Mikasa couldn""t help but smile. As they were nearing their quarters, the two girls stopped walking when they noticed Eren leaning on their cabin""s wall, waiting for someone. Sasha elbowed Mikasa playfully as she entered the cabin, leaving Mikasa. ""Don""t stay out too late, kiddos~"" she teasingly said before closing the door behind her. Mikasa glanced at the wooden door, then at her brunet childhood friend who had his stare at her this whole time. She couldn""t help but feel awkward. ""What brings you here, Eren?"" she asked, trying to sound normal. ""Waiting for you. We seriously need to talk, Mikasa. Come on, follow me."" And with that, Eren led Mikasa towards the training grounds, and walking even further to reach the forest. They didn""t stray out of the path nor did they walked too far from the grounds. There was a spot where they would chop down lumber for firewood in the forest that was only a few feet away from the training grounds. Eren sat down near the small cottage and leaned on the wall as Mikasa did the same. Feeling slightly cold, Mikasa adjusted her scarf once more, absorbing the warmth of the scarf. Eren scratched his head, not knowing how to start their conversation. ""Eren?"" Mikasa""s voice broke the silence between them. ""Y-yeah?"" the brunet stuttered, a bit startled. ""What are we going to talk about?""",2750536
1429,"The traditional institutions did not take the internet world very seriously, however, but on the Internet she could play without her face, her identity, or her sex overshadowing the strengths in her moves. Only in the Internet, where all players could be equally anonymous, was she able to shine unhindered by the stigma of her gender. She had chosen a male pseudonym to protect herself, and it wasn""t Akira""s place to confront her. He shook his head, dismissing the hint of pity he felt for his mother""s plight. She was a proud woman, and would not appreciate it. She had found her own way to advance her love for the game, and Akira could respect that. She had found her own rival, the Internet phenomenon SAI, who she played weekly at this time. It was hard not to be envious of her luck in discovering a destine rival, the someone to travel the path to the Hand of God together. Sometimes he thought Hikaru might be that someone meant for him, but Hikaru was unwilling to commit himself wholly to the game. Someday, maybe... but Hikaru""s unwillingness was a factor in Akira""s own reluctance to commit the rest of his life to Go alone. As he watched the players enter the mid-game (both using hauntingly familiar styles that Akira couldn""t admit he recognized as friends""), he forced himself to let himself just focus on the Go. Maybe by watching the beautiful, dazzling game, Akira might discover some of the answers he needed. Despite his reluctance, Akira invited Hikaru to dinner. They were sitting in his father""s Go salon, playing a game as usual. Hikaru had brought an ungodly amount of sweets and spread them out on the table, having learned from experience that Go salons didn""t serve much in the way of food. They""d just finished a game of speed Go (which Akira won by the skin of his teeth) when he decided it was time to ask. ""My mother would like to meet you,"" he said. ""Can you come to dinner on Saturday?"" Hikaru laughed at that. ""Why now?"" It was a good question, since they""d been friends for going on three years. Well, Hikaru would call them friends; it had taken Akira much longer to reconcile himself to that somewhat unbelievable fact. Aside from Go, the two had little in common. ""No idea, but my mother is going to call yours to make arrangements if we don""t set it up ourselves,"" Akira told him. It was embarrassing, but Kouko never concerned herself with teenage dignity. She was an efficient person, taking the direct route with extreme grace and manners. And she always got her way, so there was no fighting it. Hikaru blinked. ""She wants to call my parents? It""s not like you""re asking me out on a date, are you?"" Akira rolled his eyes, before stealing a stick of Hikaru""s pocky. ""I""m not? Because right after you meet my parents, we""re going to have a white wedding and honeymoon in Baghdad."" That provoked a snicker from Hikaru. ""You know, you""re starting to get better with the sarcasm thing. That was almost decent, though your delivery could use more work."" Akira just shook his head, not deigning to reply.",1112924
3778,"Sam turned to Brooke and smiled. ""Oh my god, I love this song turn it up"" Josh looked at Sam oddly but then turned it up and then smirked as he recogonized the song, Harrison leaned back in the car seat as he also recogonized the song. ""Journey down memory lane..."" Brooke and Sam nodded at Harrison""s comment. *start of flashback* ""Okay so me and Brooke are the lead singers and you two---"" An 8 yr. old Sam who had her brown hair in braided pig-tails pointed to Harrison and Josh. ""Are our back-up singers, and don""t even ask why"" Harrison nodded and held on tight to the the hairbrush as Josh held on to the stick; Brooke and Sam held on to their big wooden spoons, they whipped their heads back as the song began, they listened to the rythm for a second and then began singing to it. ""Oh Why you look so sad tears are in your eyes Come on and come to me, now Don""t Be ashamed to cry Let me see you through Cause I""ve seen the dark side, too When the night falls on you You don""t know what to do Nothing you confess Could make me love you less I""ll stand by you I""ll stand by you Won""t let nobody hurt you I""ll stand by you So If you""re mad, get mad don""t hold it all inside come on and talk to me now Hey what you got to hide I get angry too, Well, I""m allowed, like you When you""re standing at the crossroads And don""t know which path to choose Let me come along Cause even if you""re wrong I""ll stand by you I""ll stand by you Won""t let nobody hurt you I""ll stand by you Take me in into your darkest hour And I""ll never desert you I""ll stand by you.

""God we made so many mistakes during that song, we just gave up"" Sam giggled and remembered how much fun that day was and then her face became serious. ""I wish things were like how they were back then"" Harrison and Brooke faced Sam and Josh listened to her voice as he drove up to their school. ""Everything was so simple back then, we were just little kids having fun, without any worries or problems with the world, we didn""t understand what pain was because we were sheltered from that part of the world.",29783

Knightbrace, Mr. Boss, Mr. Fizz, Mr. Fibb, and Mr. Wink manage to get out of the car but it crashes into the School Bus and it results in a huge explosion. Mr. Boss then asks, ""Is everybody ok?"" They all nodded, then upon further inspection, Knightbrace asks Mr. Boss, ""Say Mr. Boss, what does C.O.O.L.B.U.S. stand for?"" Mr. Boss seems horrified and answers, ""Oh no... this isn""t a School Bus... it""s a C.O.O.L.B.U.S.! The Kids Next Door fly on one of these!""

613,"Then, you shall have obliterated all who gain power, and I shall have my kingdom."" Karla was silent for but a moment. Then, she answered, ""We have made a bargain. Bring me the girl, and I will unlock her voice. ' Transition ""Princess Gemini?"" Maar asked the young lady in the lead, ""Will you play your lyre tonight? Please?"" The rest of the group groaned. ""You hear it every night,"" Magnus said, speaking for Gem, ""Can""t she take a break?"" ""And deprive the world of such enchanting music?"" Maar explained, ""Why it would be a crime!"" ""Then consider her under arrest,"" Gerrek said, picking the little sprite up by his shirt tales, "" Now shut up."" ""Hey, can""t she speak for herself?"" Prince Orson asked. Leaf turnbed to him and smacked him across the head. ""OW! What was that for?"" ""That was for Gem,"" Leaf said, ""If you""re going to travel with us, then you have to understand that Gem can""t speak; she""s mute. And only Magnus and I can hear her thoughts. It""s a half-elf thing."" ""And this is our leader?"" the spoiled prince outraged, ""A mute princess? I was better off with the prospect of dying in the desert! At least then my death would have meant something!"" Orson stopped, drew his sword, and cried, ""That does it! Magnus, draw your sword! We""re goin"" at it right now!"" ""I""m not a soldier,"" Magnus said, ""I won""t fight you. Besides, I don""t have a sword."" Beside him, Gem growled, and drew her own, stepping up to Orson""s challenge. ""Oh, the little quiet girl""s gonna fight me. I""m so scared."" ""You should be,"" Magnus and Leaf said at the same time, for then, Gemini charged, and with one quick strike, disarmed Prince Orsonwith the point of her sword. ""Okay!"" Orson cried, ""I really am scared! Put your sword away!"" Gem sheathed her blade, then Magnus and Leaf both stepped up to Orson and both said, ""Do not tempt me again, for next time, treaty or no, I will have your life. Your mother will deal with me as she sees fit."" ""The sun is getting low,"" Greebus said. ""We need to make camp for the night."" They dropped their gear and weapons on the ground- marking where they would sleep- unrolled blankets and built a cook fire to roast their dried meats and stale bread. The night had grown cold, as cold as the day had been sweltering, and the wind blew spurts of sand around and in the camp, getting into the company""s eyes, ears, noses, and everywhere else. One consolation was the softness of the sand as they lay to sleep. All slept heavily, except the Princess and her body guard. Gem walked over to where Magnus kept watch for the night. ""Are you tired?' she asked him. ""Not really,' he answered, ""My mother""s kind don""t need much sleep. Thanks for defending me, by the way.' ""No one, even a prince, has the right to insult either myself or those I love,' she said, laying her head on his shoulder. ""Are you sure of your feelings for me, Princess?' Magnus asked, ""We""ve only known each other for a short time.' ""I""ve never been more sure of anything in my life,' she said. ""I love you Magnus, and I want you to stay with me.'",512464
944,"The way his eyes turned pensive when he looked at the violin, the way he looked really bothered as he watched her- he must have been thinking that he should be the one playing if only he wasn""t injured, not some amateur like her. She heaved a sigh. However, what Tsukimori-kun was thinking was very different from what she thought. It was a little over five when Kanazawa-sensei called it a day. Even though exhausted, Hihara-sempai had insisted that they grab a burger or two at the fast food chain near the train station. Kanazawa-sensei had passed, saying that he still had paperwork to finish (""I bet he thought we would ask him to treat us!"" Hihara-sempai was caught saying much later). Tsukimori-kun had merely shook his head, and politely excused himself. Next, the trumpet player expectantly turned to the other violinist. Quickly, she bowed in apology, ""I""m really sorry, Hihara-sempai, I can""t- I mean, I still need to run an errand for my mother."" His grin faded a little, ""Huh? But Hino-chan..."" ""Next time, I promise I""ll go,"" Kahoko assured as she clapped her palms together, pleading. Before Tsuchiura could convince her otherwise, she already waved her goodbye and ran in the direction Tsukimori took. True enough, she could already see the male violinist a couple of meters away. ""Tsukimori-kun! Tsukimori-kun!"" He stopped just as she dashed to his side, her breathing erratic from running. ""Hino?"" he asked, mildly surprised. ""Why are your here?"" ""Shouldn""t you be at that fast food chain?' he nearly wanted to add. Kahoko merely smiled as she wiped the thin sheet of sweat on her forehead with her handkerchief. ""I need to go to the convenience store. It""s in the same direction as your house."" When he did not comment and merely continued looking at her, she hastily added, ""Erm.. I need to buy a carton of milk, and eggs- a dozen, that is. My mother forgot to buy yesterday... Erm.."" He raised his eyebrows and she unconsciously stepped back, ""Tsukimori-kun...?"" ""So?"" She blinked and echoed, ""So..?"" ""So? You didn""t have to run,"" he said disapprovingly as he eyed her disheveled state. ""What would you do if by running, you suddenly trip- and I must say that is very plausible for such a clumsy person as you- and injure yourself or damage the violin?"" He almost wanted to groan as he watched her lips form an ""O"" shape, as if only realizing now what could have happened. He really should distance himself from her- this girl was Accident Prone. ""No worries!"" she suddenly exclaimed and patted the violin case. ""I wouldn""t let anything happen to this violin, Tsukimori-kun!"" For the second time, he really considered groaning in frustration. He exhaled heavily and resumed walking. He should rest. This girl walking beside him- wait, ""What do you think you""re doing, Hino?"" She gave him a quizzical look. Narrowing his eyes, he pointed at her. ""Are you following me?' seemed illogical since she was headed in the same direction; ""Why are you walking beside me?",560480
478,"Haymitch turned to Chaff, ""See. She""s very annoying."" Chaff shrugged. ""I watched her running away in those heels, and I still think you""re overreacting."" The bartender brought over some coffee for Haymitch. He barely took a sip, when Effie was back with a bottle of cologne. She began spraying around his face, Haymitch cried out, ""Stop that. You""re getting it in my mouth."" She sniffed around him. ""It""s a little better."" She shoved some mints into his mouth and then dragged him away, as he finished the coffee as quickly as he could, placing the cup on the bar on his way out. Alone in the elevator making their way up to the sponsors"" room, Effie gave her last instructions, ""You will go try, Haymitch."" She said firmly. ""You will try to save that boy""s life."" Haymitch, sobered up a little now, realized that she was right. He pushed out the memories from his early years as a mentor when he had really tried, before it grew to be too much and all the time alone in the Victor""s Village caught up with him, making him realize just how alone he was. How alone he would always be now. But he would try and then try not to mind when he inevitably failed. The sponsor she had lined up turned out to be an older man. Before coming up here, Haymitch had assumed Effie had somehow used her looks and a possible promise of sleeping together to get someone to talk to her. Within a few minutes though, Haymitch realized this man""s interest wasn""t in Effie. He continuously talked about the Seam boy""s pretty eyes. Haymitch struggled not to throw up on this man""s pretty suit and part of him would have done it gladly. But he didn""t want to deal with the fallout from Effie. Finally the older man said, ""Send the boy some bread."" ""Actually, I get to decide what he needs."" Haymitch reminded him. With a firmer tone, the man repeated, ""Send the boy some bread."" Haymitch understood the man""s attentions all too well. He also knew that if the boy somehow made it through what the Capitol would do. This was why he hated courting sponsors; they reminded him that there were worse things than a career""s spear through the chest. Back in the penthouse, Effie was happy to see the bread, as was the boy, and nearly hugged Haymitch until the look he gave her stopped her cold. The earthquake was what ultimately killed their last tribute. The boy had been trapped under some rocks. As he was still alive, Effie tugged on Haymitch""s sleeve. ""Do you think that the sponsor would send him something? Could he still live?"" Haymitch thought that the man might, but refused to indebt the boy like that, so he answered, ""No. There""s nothing we can do."" Effie looked very distressed by this news and watched until a few hours after, the cannon sounded, as the boy""s heart beat had stopped. Haymitch barely reacted, but Effie let out a gasp. It didn""t take long for her to recover though, ""We""ll just have to try harder next year."" ""That""ll work,"" Haymitch grumbled under his breath. Effie ignored him, ""Well, I""ll call the family."" She got up, but Haymitch stopped her. ""They won""t have a phone."" ""Oh.",1497577
698,"How he""d defended King""s Landing from the armies of Stannis Baratheon, how he had a soft spot for whores, but was one of the most intelligent men to ever take the role of Hand of the King. If that man was the one who harassed my mother, I would probably be hunted down and killed soon, now that she was dead. If... if he was my father, then... I had to take a break from planting, my hands were shaking too much. The fox padded over, nudging against one of my hands. I scratched yours ears. ""How about Florys?"" It was the name of the fox from one of the funnier stories Mother would tell me as a child. The fox tilted her head, and when I scratched her ears again, she made a small, happy sound. My eyes lifted, in the direction the sellsword had vanished, ""Yes, that""ll be your name."" The unsettling knot in my stomach still wouldn""t leave. Bronn came to the hut a week later. Averill had already given me a giddy earful about getting visited by a dashing knight. I laughed at her. Dashing? The man was at least twice my age. He was gruff with a crudeness about him, but all she saw was his weathered gambeson and sword. He told me that Tyrion Lannister would be visiting. He didn""t ask my permission, and I didn""t expect it. What noble ever asks permission? It wasn""t like I didn""t expect it, but still... I was nervous. Bronn didn""t stay long, asking a few more questions Tyrion probably sent him via raven. The Eddars were all in a frenzy when I told them that the Hand of the King would be staying with the local Lord, Ryon Allyrion, specifically to visit me. Averill, in particular, was all in titters about it. ""You must be his bastard!"" She clapped her hands together, smiling broadly, ""I heard in town from Tristan, who heard from his uncle, who went to King""s Landing last year that Tyrion Lannister is one of the last Lannister""s alive, and has no known true or baseborn children! He could come to legitimize you!"" ""It""s up to King Jon to legitimize anyone,"" I muttered as I skinned some desert rabbits I""d caught the day before, ""Besides, I don""t know what he wants. Ser Bronn wouldn""t say, and I wouldn""t take his legitimizing if he offered it."" ""What?!"" Averill jumped off my hammock, startling Florys of it too, ""Why wouldn""t you want to be a Lady?!"" I shot her a look, ""My mother always taught me that nothing comes without a price. Who tracks down a bastard just to legitimize them, unless they wanted something? I don""t even know if he""s... him, in the first place,"" I sighed, ""Don""t be so quick to trust nobles, Averill. They have a lot of swords and poisons in their embroidered silk clothes. Besides-"" I smiled at her, ""-your parents still need help, right?"" She kept on like that for a whole month. Bronn returned around once a week, first with questions about my mother (which I almost never answered) then with questions about me (that I definitely never answered). Then, as I was helping gather the wheat harvest with Maenys and Braddeck, Averill came running down the road, skirts pulled up to run faster. ""They""re here!"" ""Averill, where is your father?"" Maenys asked dryly.",748687
902,"A silence fell before them. That was nothing new. Many times, Jasper and Edward had lain together in perfect silence and in perfect contentment; happy to do nothing but lie still together and hold hands to smile. The silence now was anything but comfortable. If anything, Edward was aware of a painful and very real distance between them. This was new and it was scary. Edward stumbled over the words, ""Look, Jasper,"" he swallowed, ""I""m not sure what happened to you but come inside. I""ve missed you so much. Whatever happened, we can talk about it."" In Jasper""s red eyes a glimmer of humanity was there and then was gone like smoke in the wind. ""I""d like that,"" he tried and failed to conceal his regret. Edward stepped closer to the crimson demon that had his Jasper locked inside him. ""Then come back to me, Jasper. I don""t care what""s happened to you."" Jasper lowered his head. He could no longer meet with Edward""s gaze. ""I know you""re still the man I fell in love with."" This caused a tremor of anger in Jasper""s body. ""Is that what you think?"" he asked in a voice that wasn""t human; a bestial hiss. Until now he""d been holding his hands behind his back. Revealing them made Edward""s eyes widen. Jasper""s hands were now long fingered killing tools; with an extra joint on them and long, bronze coloured claws. ""I am not the man you knew,"" he seethed. He looked at his hands and looked up, fangs protruding from his mouth; the rest of his teeth replaced with translucent sharp needles. ""These are my weapons and I am different."" Yet to Jasper""s total shock, Edward didn""t run away screaming. Instead, he threw himself on Jasper and threw his arms around him. Only the grace of god and utter shock prevented Jasper from disembowelling Edward out of instinct. Knowingly or unknowingly, Edward leaned in such a way that exposed his succulent neck to Jasper. God, he""d eaten so recently but he was always hungry. The mere sound of a human heartbeat threatened to turn Jasper into a raging animal of instinct; only Maria""s conditioning made him stop. He needed the order to feed. ""It""s alright, Jasper,"" Edward tried to sooth the savage beast that was his mate, ""Whatever is wrong, it""s nothing we can""t overcome."" Jasper began to grind his sharp teeth. This wasn""t working. In his mind, Maria""s conditioning and his own vampire nature were fighting against his old persona of Jasper Whitlock-Cullen and the human Jasper was fighting valiantly but being buried. He could not lose sight of his true purpose here. ""There""s no ""we"" Edward,"" said Jasper. Instantly, Edward froze. He looked up with shock in his bleary eyes, ""What?"" ""I mean,"" and with that, Jasper said something that he would regret for the rest of his immortal life, ""I mean that I don""t want you."" He pulled away from Edward. ""I""m sorry, but this is how it has to be."" Then he was gone like a memory. Edward stood there with his arms open, waiting for the embrace that would never come. He felt bad. Honestly, he felt worse.",1220273
2241,"She knows that if she needs to, she""ll face Regina, head to head, and give her son the heroic showdown he""s clearly plotting in his fairytale-infested head. Instead, Emma sighs, and asks him if he likes salt on his popcorn. There""s no way some lawbreaking asshole is going to get the better of Emma Swan. She""s twenty-three and powerful. Bounty hunting (the politically correct term may be bail bondsman, but she knows she""s a bounty hunter) is something she lucked into, but she is very, very good at it. A former roommate of hers, a rather stupid girl from Jersey, had ended up in the business, and told her it was good money. Emma""s bounced between jobs ever since high school, and she""s never found anything she could tolerate for more than six months. But she needs to eat, so she walks up to a bail bondman""s office and offers her services. The man looks her up and down, and tosses her a book of rules she""ll need to follow. Don""t fuck up and you""ll get paid, he tells her cynically. She ends up pulling in her first bail jumper the next day. It""s like something clicks inside her. All of the jobs she""s been through have provided her with a skill set that""s flexible, and her pretty face makes people underestimate her. She""s given a task and the bail bondsman doesn""t care how she accomplishes it as long as she doesn""t piss the police off. She collects a couple of commissions and squirrels away at least thirty percent in order to build her own bank account. In less than a year, she has enough money to start putting up her own funds and becomes a bail bondsman in her own right. It""s even better, because she""s in charge of her own life and doesn""t answer to anyone. She is not unaware of how ironic it is that she finds freedom by denying others theirs. Most of the people she posts bail for end up paying her back with a small bit of commission. It""s the ones who don""t that she secretly enjoys more. There""s nothing like the thrill of the hunt. She likes taking names and pushing back, because without fail the guys who jump bond are assholes. It""s a one hundred percent guarantee, and the law is on her side when she goes to drag the assholes back. Occasionally she pushes the threshold of illegality to do so, but that never stops her from doing anything. For Emma, the most expedient path is always the best one. The skip she""s currently chasing has a daughter at an elementary school. Most of the assholes she""s after are smart enough to cut all their ties, but every now and then one of them is unable to let go. Most of the bounty hunters she knows - they""re not friends, but she does need to keep up with the business - think they""re idiots, but she understands. She""s dressed in slacks and a polyester shirt, the kind that an elementary school teacher would wear. She has wire-frame glasses that are just out of fashion, knowing they""ll help her with the pose.",1112924
927,"It takes her awhile to admit it, but this discovery is the death knell for any hope she might have had in happy endings. The movies had always promised a joyous reunion for an orphan when they found where they belonged. Even that little kid who had to be rescued by talking mice was handed a family in the end. Emma isn""t going to get that. She can at least take the satisfaction that she did better by her son. She gave up her parental rights to get him properly adopted. It was the hardest thing she""s ever done, and while she may regret that he""s not in her life, she""s coming to terms with it. It may mean she will never see him or know what he becomes, but that uncertainty is worth the chance he has at a good life. Emma spends the entire movie watching her son instead of watching the film. The theater is about half full, and most of the patrons are closer to Henry""s age than her own. This film is riding a nostalgia wave, but Emma isn""t engaged on that level. She has vague memories of watching The Muppet Show on Nickelodeon, but was never that interested and doesn""t recall any of the details. Instead, she focuses on Henry since he""s the most fascinating thing in her life. It""s always to think that this amazing little person came from her. He""s so intelligent and lively, and there""s always something going on in his head. Having the chance to just sit and stare at him is a luxury she never thought she could afford. When the movie ends and the lights come back up, Henry is full of energy. Sitting in a dark theater is a challenge for any child, even one as naturally introverted as Henry. He can""t wait to share everything he""s thinking. Emma lets him babble, not contradicting any of his opinions about how fun the movie had been or why he thinks Kermit is the epitome of cool. She collects the empty popcorn tub in order to bin it and lets it wash over her, enjoying the moment. Henry belatedly notices she""s not contributing much to the conversation. ""Did you like it?"" Emma hates the idea of a ""happily ever after"" because life doesn""t work like that. The only unchangeable ending is death; if there""s life, then the story is still continuing. She didn""t enjoy the movie because she can""t suspend her disbelief long enough to buy into the happy ending. But she""s not going to tell Henry that. ""It was a Disney film,"" she says instead. It""s not lying if you avoid the issue. ""I thought you said everyone likes Disney."" The brilliant smile he gives is enough to sooth any misgivings she might have about misleading her child. Henry tells her they""re definitely going to see Brave together when it comes out, and next time they can sneak M&Ms into the theater. It""s supposed to be in 3-D, which means the film is going to be even more awesome. ""We can go to the show right before dinner and then go to the diner,"" he tells her, just assuming that his plans will be fine with what she wants. She looks at his face, and wishes she could promise that. But she doesn""t know where she""s going to be in six months, and she doesn""t want to make any promises she cannot keep.",1112924
1109,"She jerked when Stayne touched her again-she""d forgotten he was there. Slowly, wearily, she turned to look at him. The haunted look had never left her features, but it had returned with full force. Her dark eyes seemed too big in her colorless face. ""I should get you back upstairs before someone notices you""re gone,"" he commented. She looked very tired. Maybe it was the candlelight and the way it threw harsh shadows over everything...she slid clumsily out of the chair and stuffed her book into the bag. The slightest bit of sympathy for her rippled at the edge of his mind. She moved like an old woman and an invisible burden seemed to weight her shoulders down. His hand instinctively stayed on her back upon this display of frailty. He said nothing to her until they had reached her room. ""Well...good night,"" he said awkwardly. She acknowledged him with a nod and closed the door. A/N: Thanks to Artemis615 for reviewing. It was a long time before Aurora finally fell asleep. Her mind was whirling. In the absence of tranquilizers, her mind seemed to be working overtime. She thought about Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt and how they""d wandered the desert for forty years. That hospital...my old life was Egypt, she thought grimly, and now God""s lead me here...Underland is beautiful, but dangerous. It""s like my desert...so when do I get to the promised land? She thought about Stayne and the expression he""d gotten when she""d said she didn""t want to end up like him. A pang of guilt for making him feel bad was there, but she felt that way because she""d hit a wall. Something must have happened to him to cause him to be a murderer...or at least an accomplice to it. But what? What was it that he was hiding? We""re all hiding something, she thought grimly, every single one of us. Sin was sin in God""s eyes. Just because she""d never killed anyone didn""t make her any better than Iracebeth or Stayne. She""d done a lot of things that she wasn""t proud of as well, but she chose not to dwell on them. Those people at the hospital had thrived on guilt and used it to eat people alive from the inside out. She wouldn""t let it happen again. Then, an even more unsettling feeling came over her. There were moments that Stayne could be really rough with her. She didn""t appreciate the times that he""d dragged her around. But it had bothered her more when he""d treated her as if she was as fragile as glass. He still hadn""t sorted it out in his mind as to whether she really was crazy or not. We""re all crazy, we just have to find the brand we can live with. Her eyes slid closed. She was feeling thoroughly drained. All this mental debating was getting her nowhere but more concerned. Stayne closed his door and locked it securely behind him. In his haste, he hadn""t bothered to blow out the candles. The Oraculum was still laying open. He rolled it back up and blew out the candles. The tendrils of smoke hung in the air and he waved irritably at them to make them disperse. He was annoyed and he couldn""t figure out why.",870118
2103,"There""s someone I already love and you know who it is!"" She whispered to her blond sister. ""Yeah, yeah I know. You love James so much, blah blah blah."" Amber replied, completely ignoring Sofia""s restrains. As they reached the farthest pillar inside the hall, there stood Amber""s fiancé and another man talking to each other. The fiancé had black hair and fair skin that matched well with his teal -coloured eyes. The other man had blond hair and has the same eye colour as Amber""s fiancé. As Amber stopped walking in front of them, Sofia quickly dusted off her dress. ""Sofia, I am pretty sure you""ve met my fiancé, Prince Henry."" Amber said, as the prince bowed politely at them. ""And his cousin Prince Richard."" The said Prince Richard bowed down as well with a gentle smile on his face. Sofia blushed slightly as the blond prince took her hand a gently kissed it. She then gave him a small, awkward smile. ""It""s a pleasure to finally meet you, Princess Sofia."" Prince Richard greeted. ""The pleasure is mine."" Sofia replied, feeling a bit uneasy. Amber nudged her fiancé as she gave Sofia a small wink. ""We""ll be leaving you alone."" She said teasingly to Sofia. She and Prince Henry made their exits as they made their way to the crowd to greet more people. Sofia could only stare at her step-sister in anxiety. She took a small glance at the other prince and observed his features. He had blond hair, the same as James though the style is different. He was handsome alright and he seemed nice. He would certainly make a good husband. ""But he""s not James"" Sofia thought glumly. As the ball was near its finish, Sofia excused herself from Prince Richard and made her way out of the hall. They talked about themselves, had a few laughs and some did some dancing. She knows that Prince Richard knew that she wasn""t falling for him so, after their dance, she decided to retire to her room. While walking through the corridors, she saw a shadow just about to enter the castle. She stopped walking and stood still as she waited for that person to come inside. As that person was inside the castle, Sofia smile and called out to him. ""James."" She said quietly. James halted his walking and quickly turned around to face Sofia. ""Sofia? Is the party done?"" he asked. She walked towards him slowly as she replied. ""Well, not quite. I was just feeling tired so I decided to head to my quarters."" She replied. James gave her a small smile. ""I see."" Again, awkwardness dawned upon them. ""Well, I should probably go now-"" ""Wait-!"" James grabbed her hand on impulse, catching Sofia in surprise. They looked at each other, not knowing what to say. James felt the blood rush to his face as Sofia stared at him with wide-eyes, obviously confused. But he realized that her face too was looking quite red. After what seemed like forever of looking at each other, James finally spoke up. ""There is something I""ve been meaning to tell you."" He said, feeling very nervous. Sofia could only nod, somehow unsure on what he was going to say. He tightened his grip on her hand, looking deep in her eyes.",2750536
395,"""When you stop challenging us to truth-or-dare."" said Diego. ""Fine. You win."" ""Great. Now let""s get some rest."" ""Good night, everyone."" ""Good night."" It""s both sweet and funny, I guess. But, I""ll be back for more! Well, I""m back with more of ""Invisible Feelings"". I""m gonna show you guys how Crash and Eddie""s mother died and I hope it""s something interesting. Chapter 7: Crash""s Nightmare Later that night, in the cave, Manny, Sid, Diego, Ellie, Crash and Eddie were all asleep...except for Crash, who started tossing and turning and mumbling softly in his sleep, like there""s a nightmare coming up. ""No... mom, please....what are you doing to her, you stupid wolves.....get off her!"" Crash mumbled. Eddie opened one eye and overheard Crash mumbling in his sleep, looking a little annoyed, but concerned at the same time, because it does involve their mother, like he""s dreaming of her. He sighed softly and went back to sleep, while Crash is still dreaming of her and that horrific night of their mother""s death. Flashback ""RUN, BOYS!!!"" their mother screamed. Crash and Eddie did what their mother said and started to find a few places to hide while their mother had to deal with these blood-sucking wolves. 4 wolves started to run after her and she ran as fast as she could just to save herself and her boys. She kept running and running until she found a place to hide. She looked up and saw a log, and then, she jumped on it and hid on the inside, hoping no one would find her. Meanwhile, the wolves were looking for her and got past the log. She pops out the log and sees the wolves making their way and she quietly exits the log, hoping no one would get to her. Then, the wolves started sniffing her scent and one smelled it from behind the log. ""You lot smell something?"" one wolf asked. The other wolves started sniffing the scent and replied, ""No, mate. I don""t smell anything."" ""I""m telling you blokes, I smell something."" Then, another wolf started smelling the scent somewhere near them and answered, ""You know what? I think I do. It-it smells like a runaway possum!"" They spotted her running towards a tree and climbing it""s branches. They looked at her and wanted a piece of her quickly, so they ran towards the tree and ran around it in circles. She became completely frightened to the fact that the wolves caught her in sight and that they were gonna kill her sons. ""You might as well give up, lady and we""ll go easy on you!"" one wolf shouted. She was having none of it and she jumped out of the tree branches, which made them more furious and ran after her. She ran and ran as fast as she could, just to save her breath and get back to her sons in one piece until... ""Leave our mother alone!"" Crash shouted. She saw Crash and Eddie standing in the tree branches, throwing rocks at the wolves, and also ran after them as well, in which their mother followed them and that they""ll get back to the cave, so they could rescue mom. However, one wolf confronted her and she backed away slowly, while he laughed sinisterly at her, saying, ""You""re gonna wish you""d never been born!""",1276465

1638,"Pike let out a snort of laughter. ""Sure. Earning."" ""What""s that supposed to mean?"" Kirk asked. ""It""s not exactly earned if you""re cheating your opponents for all they""re worth."" ""I don""t know what you""re talking about."" Kirk insisted, raising his glass to lips, but before he could take a sip, Pike""s hand darted out and grabbed his wrist. Kirk looked at the older man in surprise. Pike just smiled and reached his free hand up to the edge of Kirk""s sleeve and pulled out a card. He flipped it in fingers so he could see it. ""Let""s see... ace of spades. Tell me again about your honest game,"" he said, releasing the other man""s wrist. Kirk smiled. ""I still earned it. If they""re too stupid to notice they""re being cheated they don""t deserve to keep their money."" ""Maybe, but I estimate they were about thirty seconds away from busting your ass. How long do you think it would""ve taken them to find this?"" he asked, holding up the card. ""I could""ve taken them."" Kirk said confidently, and with a jerk of his wrist finished his drink. Pike shook his head, but he could tell that Kirk was serious. The boy was fearless. That was good. He smiled, as he suddenly felt sure that he""d picked the right man for the job. ""I want you to rob a bank for me."" Kirk spluttered on the last of his drink. ""You want me to what?"" he asked coughing, but then continued without waiting for an answer. ""You""re crazy."" ""I heard you""re the best."" ""You heard wrong. You have to have done something to be the best. I""ve never robbed a bank. I can""t do it."" ""Your father could""ve."" Kirk refused to look at Pike.

""It""s a step up from cheating a few hundred bucks off couple of idiots in a backwater bar,"" he pointed out. Again, Kirk laughed.

""He""s more than that. He""s gotten me out of more than a few tight scrapes."" ""Fine. Be at this address the day after tomorrow at three to meet the team.

3221,"""Do you want some water,"" Eve asked surprisingly kindly, taking Jamila off guard. Jamila slowly nodded cautiously, and Eve pulled the tape off carefully to try and not hurt Jamila. Eve put the canteen up to Jamila""s mouth and Jamila opened and immediately felt the cool liquid run down her throat ridding her off the salty sandy taste. After a few seconds Eve pulled it away and Ardeth took over as he stood above her holding two large metal bracelets or what she thought was bracelets. ""If you promise not to try and attack us, I""ll put these on instead of those bindings, so that you can eat,"" Jamila was about ready to say kiss her ass, but then she heard her stomach lurch suddenly and make a roar. She groaned and nodded. He bent down slowly and put the bracelets on before he undid the bindings. She knew the bracelets were blessed, because as she tried to will the wind to herself the bracelets shocked her. She frowned as Ardeth laughed at her attempt. ""Like I said before, if you""ll be good then you can stay like that. As for your legs they are staying like that,"" he said with a smirk. Jamila rolled her eyes as he handed her a ham sandwich and her own canteen. She immediately went at it and had it done in a matter of seconds along with the water. She was glad that no one looked at her as she did this because she would have been very, very embarrassed. Now that she had finished her food, she started planning her escape and a way out of her bindings. She tried to stand up, but found that the bindings around her legs wouldn""t let her. She sighed in frustration and tried again, and managed to get at least to the hammock that was close to her. As she plopped down it made a squeaky sound making the black guy turn around from the wheel and look at her. He looked her up and down at first and smirked, before he turned back to look at the others. She couldn""t hear him, but she knew he was telling them something about her. She saw Alex look up at her and then look back at Ardeth and say something making Ardeth nod. Alex then began walking toward her and she tried to stand up, but failed and fell back on the hammock making Alex laugh. ""Need help there,"" Alex said tauntingly. ""Nope, do you need help getting your ass kicked? I could help you if you untied my legs,"" Jamila said batting her eyelash innocently, making Alex scoff. ""You couldn""t kick my ass, even if you gave it your best,"" Alex replied with a laugh. Jamila growled out of anger before saying, ""You wanna put that to a test."" Alex shrugged his shoulders and said, ""I would, but you""d lose. Plus Ardeth told me not to untie you, and I don""t disobey orders. Unlike you."" Jamila got a confused look on her face before blurting out, ""What."" ""Back in the museum, you were going to kill my little sister and then you saved her and got hurt in the process. Why,"" Alex asked sitting down on the hammock with her. Jamila stared at him for a moment debating whether to strangle him now that he was in range or tell him. She chose the safest way. She shrugged and said, ""Don""t know really.",806976
1311,"Matt""s hands left my body and leaned over and grabbed my clothes of the bed. He motioned for me to sit on his lap and I did. He leaned over and captured my lips. The kiss was tender and sweet as he took my tank top and helped me put my arms into it. He pulled away for only a minute so I could pull it over my head then we went back to kissing me. Next I felt him motion for me to raise my leg and pull it close to him. I stepped into the underwear he had just pulled off of me mere moments ago. As he pulled it up he made sure to let his hands brush against ever part of my legs, but never once straying to the one place my body begged him to touch. I lifted up so he could pull the underwear over my bottom and then sat down back on his lap. Next he took my booty shorts and he did the same thing he had down with the underwear. When he was finished he pushed me down onto my bed and let himself drape over me. I took the bottom of his shirt into my hands and tugged on it until he lifted his arms and let me pull it off of him. Next I let my hands fall too his pants. I unzipped the zipper and then pulled the button loose. Matt kicked them off and they fell to the floor next to my bed. Now Matt was left only in his boxers. I let my hands linger on his chest for a moment being careful to not press to hard on the radiation burns. Then I let my hands lightly trace across his chest down to his stomach all the way down to his boxers. As I reached for the hem off it Matt grasped my hand and pulled it away. Matt brought my hand up to his lips and kissed it. Then he leaned down and kissed my lips before pulling away and sitting up. Matt swung his legs over the bed and then stood up. He walked over to his part of the room and pulled back his covers. I did the same as I reached up and turned off the light on the side of my room. What happened between us was to be kept quiet. What we had just shared was a moment of comfort. It was a moment to let our minds drift away from our problems. The weird thing was, normally I would have felt that nasty thing called guilt build up in my stomach, but instead I felt nothing. Everything I had just done with him felt right. Matt turned off his light and turned over in his bed away from me. I did the same as I stared at the curtain that hid the mahogany doors. For a little while I sat there thinking of what had just happened and what consequences would it bring later, but eventually when I heard Matt""s light snores float across the room I allowed my eyes to drift close and my mind to float into a dreamless sleep. I hope you guys really enjoyed this chapter. I meant to have this chapter a hot and bothering kind of scene, so I hope it was. I know their moving fast, and I""m sorry if they are, I""m really trying not to, but I know that you guys have at least had one guy in your life that let your relationship move to fast. I have, and as much as I should say I regret it, I don""t, because I still love him and care about him till this day. Anyway, hope this satisfied those dark pleasures you guys might have been craving.",806976
1450,"Jamila shut her eyes again and groaned, ""Of all the things to bring me down and it was a book."" Imhotep laughed at her words and slowly stood. ""Well now that you are awake and well. I believe I will leave so that you can continue doing what you were doing before you fell,"" he said handing her the book she had been trying to reach. ""Thank you father,"" Jamila said without realizing her words sooner. Imhotep""s eyes widen and his head jerked toward her. It took a few minutes for Jamila to register what she said and when she did she looked up at him and said, ""Sorry it slipped."" Imhotep""s eyes went soft and he smiled, ""I do not mind. I have always thought of you as my daughter anyway, and besides if I am with your mother then that only means I am your step father anyway."" Jamila smiled and nodded. ""I""ll leave now. I must go see how you""re mother is doing with the child,"" Imhotep said still speaking in English and still surprising Jamila. Jamila nodded and he slowly left out the sliding door. He slid it shut and left her to her own business. Jamila opened the book and turned to the page she remembered in her dream, or more so, her memory. Her memory had been right about all that had happened. As she read the pages the blank spots in her memory were slowly forming. The only question now was, could Alex O""Connell really be Amun reincarnated, and if so why should it matter so much to her now? Guess what? I""M BACK. Yep I""m back for now peoples. I heard about the new movie for the Mummy coming out and decided I might as well try my hand at this story again. I don""t know how long my inspiration will last, but hope and pray for me that it will last a while. I got some new and good ideas for this story since I have forgotten the old ones, so it might be a little off, but hey at least I""m writing again right. I hope you like it though as I create it and I hoped you loved this chapter. I""d like to thank my loyal readers and the reviewers for giving me inspiration to write this again, I only hope that you keep giving me inspiration and the strength to go on. PLEASE REVIEW NO FLAMES +Dreaming Memories + Alex sat farthest from the others on the air balloon. He had a lot on his mind to think about, and he didn""t want to have people bothering him constantly, like his mother. Ever since he saw that girl he couldn""t help but feel like she was familiar to him. He felt drawn to her and couldn""t help, but feel bad as he fought her, or whenever someone else hurt her. It was like some inner voice was telling him not to hurt her; like that inner voice had feelings for her. Alex shook his head. It was impossible for him to like her with what she had done, plus he barely knew her. Yet he was still drawn to her. He slowly closed his eyes to rest his mind and felt himself drift off to sleep slowly. Alex stood facing his opponent cautiously. His opponent who resembled Jamila or more so was the ancient Egyptian princess Jamila in a training outfit. This Jamila had black hair and gold braids in it.",806976
2091,"It was going to be a bit of a trial because the place was so maze-like. ""You""re going to help him get outside? Have you lost what""s left of your mind?! What""s the matter with you?!"" Kyo raged. Tohru backed away from the orange-haired boy, pale and trembling. ""But I thought it would be a good idea...he""s so miserable, you know...."" Yuki sighed and dragged Kyo out of Tohru""s face. ""What he means, Miss Honda, is that we""re mostly free from Akito""s influence out here. So long as we don""t go into the house, especially down to that room, we""re pretty safe. If we bring him here, we""ll have to deal with his bossiness."" ""I""m with them on this one,"" Haru grumbled, ""sorry..."" Tohru squared her shoulders. ""Okay, I understand. I""m going to have to do this myself."" ""Wait! You""ll get us all in trouble, you moron!"" ""If you""re so scared, go back to the garden! You can say you didn""t know when I was going in for him!"" Kyo groaned in disgust and chased after her. ""I hate girls,"" he said emphatically. Haru chuckled. ""Wait a couple of years,"" he smirked, ""you""ll change your tune."" The four of them stampeded inside. Isuzu watched them from the top of the stairs with a dark scowl on her face. Her expression landed on Tohru before she stalked out of sight. She""s upset with me, Tohru lamented, because she knows what we""re doing. ""So...is today the big day?"" Shigure asked, startling them all. ""Do you even know what we""re doing?"" Haru asked. ""Well, there""s four of you and you""re all heading toward Akito""s room. Plus I heard Tohru and Akito talking last night. Dog""s ears, you know,"" he said with a wink. ""Are you here to stop us, then?"" Yuki asked, a tinge of hope in his voice betraying him. ""Nope."" ""Let""s go, then,"" he said, resigned. When they reached Akito""s room, Akito was having a very heated argument with Okami. His cheeks had reddened slightly and his fingers were digging into the armrests of his wheelchair. ""I am the master of this house! It""s time you stopped telling me where I can and can""t go!"" he demanded. ""The other master left me orders about you! He trusts me to do what is best for you,"" Okami insisted. ""Well, he""s gone now, isn""t he! That means I""m in charge!"" They realized they had an audience. Okami looked as if she""d dealt with all she could handle for the moment and was near weeping. ""What is it? What happened?"" Tohru asked gently. ""He""s gone. Again. He left before any of us woke up,"" Akito spat, ""Uncle always does that. He never said goodbye, either."" Tohru""s hand went to her mouth. No wonder he was so upset. He must have just found out. ""Master Akito says that he wants to go outside,"" Okami said in a nervous near-laugh, ""but his health is far too frail for that! I don""t want Hatori coming back to a dead boy!"" ""What use is living if I must always be afraid of dying?!"" Akito demanded. It was Shigure, wonderful dog-spirited man, who diffused the situation. ""Okami,"" he said gently, ""why don""t we just let him out for one day? If he doesn""t seem well, we""ll just keep him in from now on. But he""s right-even waking up in the morning can be dangerous.",870118
3339,"""The Jewel of Four Souls...It must not fall into...into evil hands...I trust that you would guard it well, but...but I do not want you to have the burden and...and the pain it will bring...It is your decision to make...my child...."" ""I will,"" Kikyo said, ""I will accept whatever you have, Lady Sonoa. I will take the Jewel!"" ""If that is your wish...Then farewell, Kikyo...my pupil...my friend...my sister..."" she said the last words as she looked up, closed her eyes...and made one last long sigh. ""Sonoa?"" Kikyo asked waveringly, shaking her mentor""s shoulder. The hand in hers was cold, and slack. ""SONOA!"" she cried as she laid he head on Sonoa""s chest, and wept. The next morning, after they burned Sonoa""s body, and put her ashes in an urn, to be buried in the village of her birth, Shako stood on the steps of the Shrine in front of Kikyo and Keade. He bowed, and gave Kikyo a necklace; a chain of white prayer beads attached to a lavender crystal. ""This I give into your keeping,"" Shako said to the young woman before him. ""To keep pure and holy...to protect. The Shikon no Tama."" Kikyo said no words. She took the Jewel, and concentrated. When she looked at her hand, it seemed like any crystal...but she knew its price. She and her sister watched Shako descend the stairs, and lead his warriors away from their village. AN: I know from the show that it was Songo""s grandfather that gave the Sacred Jewel to Kikyo, but they never said how he knew about her. So I made him Sonoa""s (my OC) older brother. P.S. Thanks to Eien for correctining the name of Songo""s grandfather. I have done my best to go through here and correct it. Ch. 4 A Heavy Burden They started coming almost immediately. The night after the slayers had gone, the first of the monsters had tried to sneak into Kikyo""s own room. It was a serpent that tried to strangle her as she slept. But her sixth sense had awakened her in time to grab her dagger and stab it. It tried to slither away, but he took an arrow from her quiver and stabbed it again, slicing it in two. She never wore the Jewel after that. The following morning, she spoke with the elder monk, and they had a special shrine bult to house the Jewel, a stand in the center of the room held the Jewel, and many of the archer priests surrounded the building. And Kikyo moved her meager belongings to rooms that were much closer to the miniature shrine, that she might also guard it closely. When she was not guarding the Jewel""s shrine, she was going about the village, patrolling the boarders of the village or attending the sick and injured. As she walked about, many who she had known would stare. Men mostly, for they found her desirable. More men, young and old, came seeking her favor during that first year of protecting the Jewel. Most nobles and warriors only did so to try and take the Jewel, but she was too intelligent to fall for their hollow flattery. They cared not for her...only the Shikon no Tama...and they felt not love, but lust. The women of the village, however, were somewhat divided.",512464
1510,"She shrugged her shoulders as well as she could while hanging on to Percy to show she didn""t know what was up with the empty cells and more than he did. ""Well this seems like a place as good any to sleep,"" he said. Annabeth nodded. Percy went into the nearest cell and put Annabeth down, hoping that if anything attacked them the bars could serve as some sort of protection. ""Are you good?"" He asked. She nodded again, and rested her head against his shoulder breathing heavily. Noticing her I""m-in-pain-but-I""m-too-strong-and-proud-to-admit-it look, Percy fished out the bag of Ambrosia. Giving her another dose this soon could be dangerous, but enough time had probably passed, and if her expression was anything to go by, she needed it. ""Here,"" he said, breaking off a small corner of the divine food and handing it to her. ""Thanks."" She ate it quickly. Looking at the ambrosia in his hand, Percy felt his stomach growl and he remembered that he hadn""t eaten anything since they""d fallen into Tartarus. Picking up a square, he looked it over, drool practically falling out of his mouth as the smell of freshly baked cookies wafted to him. ""Hey, Annabeth, do you know if this stuff can be substituted at real food?"" he asked. She frowned, looking at it. ""I don""t know. I""ve never had any need for it before now. But, now that I think about it, I""m not hungry. Logically, it should heal an empty stomach just like a wound. Try it in super small portions, just to be safe."" Percy anxiously nibbled the edge. Instantly, the taste of warm cookies exploded in his mouth. He swallowed, and at first nothing happened, but finally he started to feel something in his stomach. Slowly but surely the gripping pain of hunger was leaving. He smiled wide. ""Did it work?"" Annabeth asked, but his smile already told her the answer. ""Now, water."" ""That""s easy,"" Percy stated closing his eyes. It took some effort, but he finally located a small puddle of water about twenty feet away from them. Concentrating even harder, he brought it over to them. It was tougher than it should""ve been though, like something was smothering his power. ""Here,"" Percy said, cupping his hands and mentally pouring the water into them. He gently gave Annabeth a long sip. ""Thanks,"" she muttered, wetting her lips. She looked up at him and smiled. ""There are some definite advantages to dating the son of Poseidon,"" she said almost thoughtfully. Percy laughed and pulled her into a tight hug. They sat like that for a few minutes before, as usual, Percy decided to ruin the moment. A huge yawn racked his jaw. Annabeth laughed, but pulled away. ""You need to get some sleep, Seaweed Brain. I""ll take first watch."" Percy mumbled his thanks. And closed his eyes, but reopened them as a thought occurred to him. ""Speaking of keeping watch, where are all the monsters Nico kept talking about? I don""t mean to sound ungrateful or jinx us, but does it seem a little odd to you?"" A crease appeared between Annabeth""s eyebrows, and Percy could tell that she had been thinking the same thing.",2943978
2941,"This time, Sofia let go of her book, the said item falling on the ground as she wrapped her arms around his torso. ""I love you, Sof."" he whispered ever so gently at her ear. ""I love you too, James."" she replied. Cupping her cheek with his hand, James leaned closer towards Sofia and placed a soft kiss on her lips. Shyly, she kissed him back and placed a hand on top of James"". Unbeknownst to them, a certain prince hid by the wall of the castle just a few meters away from the stables. His clenched fists shivered as he held a box in his hands. oh no Hugo enters the party and decided to form some sort of triangle. le gasp. so much wow. And that oh, so cheesy and fluffy moment at dem stables. Huehue. I""ll be back. (Arnold S. reference hihi) HEYA! So yeah! It""s a miracle that I updated so damn early this time, amirite? Well, my New Year""s resolution for this year is to actually finish the stories that I kept hanging from 2015. I have, like, 5 still incomplete stories and I want to finish them all before 2016 ends. And I updated early this time as a ""gift"" because I kinda left the story hanging for a veeeeeeeeeery long time now hahahaha. I""m absolutely sorry for that. Good luck to me, and I hope you enjoy this chapter! ""What the hell James?!"" Hugo said, his voice rising as he took a step forward, his glare piercing at James. The said prince abruptly leaned away from Sofia, his heart pounding against his chest. Someone saw him with Sofia, hugging and kissing her. He marched towards the two, as if he was about to punch James right in the face. ""Hugo... what are you-"" ""Why the hell are you kissing your sister?"" he asked, confused at the same time infuriated. ""Don""t tell me..."" ""Okay, listen, Hugo. First of all, we""re not even related by blood."" James said, the princess still in his arms. Sofia looked up at James, not knowing what to say or do. She wished she could say at least a word to Hugo. On the other hand, the dark-haired prince still glared at the other prince. Hugo placed the box down and went for James"" collar to clutch on them tightly, surprising James. ""Screw that, James. You know that""s forbidden. You know full well that that""s forbidden!"" James gritted his teeth as he forcibly pushed Hugo, making him stumble but not fall on the ground. Sofia intervened with their fight before anyone decided to hit the other. She stood in between of them, her arms outstretched to keep a distance between the two. ""Stop it, you two! Nothing good comes out in fighting."" she said sternly. The two could only glare at each other. ""We are aware, Hugo. But it""s not our fault that we feel this way for each other."" Sofia said softly as she stared at Hugo with great sincerity. Hugo""s glare softened a bit as he heard Sofia""s explanation. He scoffed, realizing that nothing good will come out of their argument. Without saying a word, he picked the box up and turned his back on the couple and walked away. ""W-wait, Hugo!"" Sofia called out, stepping back away James and catching up with the other prince. Reluctantly, Hugo stopped walking and turned around to face Sofia.",2750536
141,"You may act like you don""t care, but we all can tell that you secretly do. You""ve always been there to listen to one of us rant even when you didn""t have to...even when we forgot you probably needed to as well. Hell! You practically saved my life the other day at work when I nearly grabbed the wrong thermos out of the fridge. God! Just thinking about drinking Miss. Noodles pee makes me want to vomit,"" Scott joked with a laugh, which quickly earned him one of my own. However, it seemed that wasn""t all of his speech, as he went on to say, ""But either way, if that doesn""t prove that you""re not a bad person then maybe this might. When Allison and I were having problems last year, and Stiles thought he was going to lose his mind running back and forth between us, you bought her a burner phone just because you thought that it might make things easier for us; not to mention the fact that you""d been saving that money for a new one yourself. Oh, and don""t think I""m going to forget that one about Jackson either. Even when none of us, but Lydia, could tolerate him and his constant bullying, you still tried to help him out in chemistry by not only giving him your notes, but forcing him to sit down with you as you went over them with him. I don""t think I""ve ever seen him so shocked in his life that someone wasn""t actually afraid of him, or intimidated by his insults. Yet you still tried, because you told him that if he didn""t man up, I""d be the least of his worries about staying on the Lacrosse field. Though, honestly, I think the most amazing feat out of all that is probably just you becoming friends with Stiles, and being able to keep up with his crazy little sarcasm day in and day out. Don""t get me wrong, I love Stiles like a brother, but I think you""re the only one who actually enjoys all of his jokes...and he""s had some pretty bad ones just so you know."" With glistening eyes, I couldn""t help but laugh at that last part, because one, Scott was right. Stiles might be a master at sarcasm, but sadly, when he did actually try to be funny it never really turned out that great in his favor. However, I think what probably shocked me the most about that, was just knowing how much I really did like him. I was willing to endure all of those horrible numbers just to see him smile even once. Yet, what probably actually floored me the most, was the sudden realization I had from the rest of his words. The ones where I realized just how much I cared for all of them in general; not just because they were some characters on a T.V. show. From the sounds of it (unintentionally, mind you), I was actually willing to go to these sort of extreme lengths just to make sure that none of them had to struggle any more than they already do. Tossing those thoughts back and forth inside my head, I felt the inner turmoil take over once more, but Scott was quick to quiet it once again with his next words as he reached out to place a gentle comforting hand upon my shoulder, ""But honestly, I just wish that you""d see that none of us here are pitying you.",806976
2219,"Meanwhile, up in the stands, Lara was sitting bolt upright in between next to Gwen, who had saved her a seat, a feeling of anticipation in the pit of her stomach; she felt like she was about to do something important and amazing instead of watching a bloodbath unfold for pure entertainment. She""d never been to a tournament, much less one sponsored by a royal family. According to Gaius, Arthur was the reigning champion, and he""d never lost a swordfight... With a sickening lurch, a horrible thought struck Lara: what if Arthur did lose? Lose his focus or his footing just for one second, and then it would be the end, just like that. No... she thought. Surely it won""t happen... no one would dare hurt the king""s son... Drums sounded out from somewhere, joined by the horns soon after. It was starting! The atmosphere had already been electric with excitement, but now the air itself seemed to be quivering in anticipation. The competitors strode out of a side entrance quietly with determined faces, each believing that they would be the last man standing. As they formed two lines of twelve Lara sat, if possible, a little straighter, straining to see where Arthur was. Oh, there he was- second to last in the second row. He was eyeing a man in yellow robes grimly, seemingly already dreading the fight. Lara""s thoughts were interrupted when Uther swept into the arena. ""Knights of the Realm,"" he boomed, ""it is a great honour to welcome you to the Tournament of Camelot. Over the next three days you will come to put your bravery to the test, your skills as warriors, and of course, to challenge the reigning champion, my son, Prince Arthur."" Arthur shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot as every eye in the place turned to him. She caught his eye and gave him a small smile; he nodded at her in acknowledgement. ""Only one of you can have the honour of being crowned champion, and he will recieve a prize of one thousand gold pieces,"" Uther continued. A woman on the side opened a small chest on a nearby table: the crowd oooohed and ahhhhed at the coins, glinting gold in the sunlight. ""It is in combat that we learn a knight""s true nature- whether he is indeed a warrior, or a coward. The Tournament begins!"" Uther declared, and the crowd burst into applause. The competitors bowed their heads in submission and marched dutifully away, leaving the first two to fight- which, unfortunately, included Arthur. Lara watched with wide eyes as Arthur and his opponent- Lara could not see his face but his robes were brown, so Lara had decided to call him Brownie- unsheathed their swords. Arthur did his famous little twist with it before taking his stance. Then, as though either of them could bear the suspense no longer, they both lunged for each other, the swords meeting with a solid clank! Arthur countered the attack and stood off again, circling him. Lara held her hands up to her mouth, biting her nails furiously. The speed at which the Brownie and Arthur were moving was admirable- it was graceful, almost like a dance; it was too bad the dance involved weapons.",2855986
258,"Uh... You and Benny, huh?"" Lunetta""s eyebrows furrowed, she looked over at him to see his strict jaws, taut and lips pursed. His eyes narrowed on the dirt road they were driving down, making fluent curves and turns. ""What are you talking about?"" ""I""m asking uh..."" Vaas itched the back of his head and shrugged. ""Are you guys a thing?"" ""What?"" She shot back, eyebrows furrowing with confusion, she immediately assumed that Benny had lied about them being a ""thing"". Vaas rose one hand in defense from the wheel, eyes still focused on the road. ""I""m just asking. I mean, you two are so close with one another. It makes me wonder, you know? Even if he hasn""t fucked you yet, I can see Benny being that prudish type of guy."" Lunetta groaned, rolling her eyes and falling limp into the window. ""Fuck you Vaas."" ""Is that a yes, or a no? I am getting mixed vibes from you."" ""It""s a fucking no. Jesus!"" ""Alright, Alright."" He exclaimed, a smirk suddenly forming again. ""I was just curious."" He let out a hearty chuckle, seeming much less gloomier than he was before he asked the question. ""So you don""t want to fuck Benny?"" ""What the fuck Vaas?"" She hit him in the knee with a closed fist and the car came to a full stop, everything froze as Vaas directed his gaze towards her. ""You don""t ever fucking do that again. I am in charge here, remember?"" ""Yes. I remember."" She croaked out, he pulled his foot off the break and the car moved forward. Getting closer and closer to Lunetta""s true destination. Badtown was no different from what she had seen in her dream, the conditions as said were inhumane and certainly not something she was accustomed to having been raised in Amanaki which was peaceful and innocent. Vaas didn""t let her stray off once, guiding her through the village, he would look back every so often to make sure she was following. ""I could just sell you Chica, right here and get a nice price to. You""d have no choice, but to fuck me when I want you to."" ""I would rather kill myself."" She shot back, he laughed deep from his throat, he stopped in front of the shack with a large sign hung over the open door labeled ""Guns and Supplies.' Vaas looked over at Lunetta, a warning on his face. ""Stay here and if I come back and you aren""t here, I will hang you with a noose."" She rolled her eyes and crossed her arm as if she had anywhere to go. ""That would be doing me a favor, bozo."" He stuck his tongue at her before disappearing into the store. Leaning back into the door frame, she took this moment to look around. She couldn""t see the man and White, more Buck, or anyone for that matter that appeared in her dream. The one that was remotely familiar was the setting, which was as it was... Horrid. She closed her eyes and let her head fall back, running off would be a bad idea because Vaas would find her and he would kill her. She just sat here, finally realizing the mess she had gotten into, there was no way she was gonna get her revenge at this point.",6234395

The DCFDTL look at each other and then they say while the make a sinister smile, ""Nice try ""responsible adults"", but ever since we were almost kidnapped by a stranger that promised us candy if we stepped inside his van, we were reprogrammed to prevent being fooled by adults again. Also while you told father your story we activated our mecha suit and we will prepare to destroy you ourselves! Mr. Wink and Mr. Fibb then summon their superchair to prepare to fight back. Knightbrace and Mr. Fizz ended up tied up with dental floss as Father says to them, ""Since you robbed me of my evil ambition of destroying Sector V is gone, I guess my new evil ambition is to destroy the ones who destroyed Sector V... PREPARE TO DIE!"" Then Father looks up and sees the Superchair and the Delightful Mecha-suit falling next to him as they contnue to fight. Father then hears someone eating popcorn. Father turns around and sees a Japanese girl in a oversized green shirt and black pants, eating popcorn. Father then says, ""Say Kuki, you""re didn""t get the job of Grim Reaper again now did you?"" Then she shakes her head and continues to eat her popcorn. Father is shocked and says, ""Hey HOLD ON! I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!"" Numbuh 3 then says, ""Of course not silly, me and my friends we just watching Mr. Boss, Mr. Wink, Mr. Fibb, Mr. Fizz, and Knightbrace suffer and we see that they""ve had enough."" Father then asks, ""Your friends?"" Numbuh 1 then shouts, ""KIDS NEXT DOOR! BATTLE STATIONS!"" 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! And so they operate a giant robot that looks like Numbuh 2 and they remove the superchair from the Mansion and they manage to defeat the Delightful Mecha-suit. Numbuh 3 and Numbuh 5 untie Knightbrace and Mr. Fizz and they blast Father with fire extinguishers.

2905,"Nick had left the table a few minutes ago and now returned with a six pack of Budweiser. Lilly, who hardly ever drank alcohol, needed a little persuading before she took one of the bottles. But finally she conceded and allowed Chris to open the bottle for her with a lighter. ""Cheers,"" Nick said and raised his bottle. ""Here""s to Rush and Lassing, our dear colleagues!"" ""Cut it, Vera,"" said Chris, but he was grinning. Lilly was surprised how easily Chris dealt with the whole situation. He seemed completely unperturbed, although it had originally been him who had had those fears and doubts. ""Whatever,"" Lilly murmured and raised her own bottle. ""Here""s to the solution of the case!"" ""Here""s to James Jarvis and his story,"" Stillman said, raising his bottle. ""The story that will finally dot the i""s and cross the t""s!"" ""Here""s to Natalya,"" said Will Jeffries. ""To justice!"" Everyone looked at Chris. He pondered for a moment, then he raised his bottle as well. ""Here""s to teamwork,"" he said, and his voice was solemn rather than playful. ""To trust, to persistence, and to friendship. In other words: to my partner. To Lilly."" Lilly blushed. She did not quite understand why Chris suddenly got so solemn, and she was half fearing that Nick would comment on Chris""s choice of words. But mysteriously enough, Nick kept his big mouth shut and simply raised his bottle to her. ""Can I talk to you?"" Chris asked her silently. ""Later?"" Lilly looked at him. ""Sure,"" she said. ""What is it?"" ""Later,"" Chris repeated. ""When they""re gone."" Lilly nodded. She had no idea what this was all about, but she couldn""t help feeling as if all the others knew something that she didn""t.

I mean, the Jarvis""s laid an information against her back then, didn""t they?"" Will smiled. ""I expected this question,"" he said, ""and therefore I""ve been going through the old files lately. I actually found the old documents, and when I read them, it occurred to me that I had indeed heard of the story."" ""Tell us,"" said Chris. ""Please."" ""It wasn""t my case,"" said Will warningly. ""I only know what I learned from my colleagues. I was very young back then, and full of enthusiasm for my own cases. I didn""t pay that much attention to the others."" ""But still you remember this one."" ""Yes,"" said Will musingly. ""I remember it, because the whole department was eager to find Natalya. She was really a beautiful girl, and all the officers wanted to find her and be her knight in armor. They""d make up their own theories of how this girl was kidnapped by brutal Russian gangsters, and how she was kept in a sort of solitary confinement... and then one day, one of those valiant officers would find a lead and discover her. That sort of stuff."" ""The gallant knight upon a fine white steed,"" said Lilly. ""Officers don""t change, do they? Still this thought is for most people the main reason to join the police.""",240213

A similar corpse came out, except it was grayish all over, not violet. The cleric identified it as a Ghoul, and assisted the acolyte by Blessing her and the Ghoul at the same time, cursing it in the process. The Ghoul went down in ten turns with the acolyte alone. ""Very good. A Ghoul is somewhat strong and should not be tackled with unless you are 40 or higher. Bomfrey, you""re next..."" The cleric called upon the female acolyte who looked boyish for her size. A Zombie Prisoner came out from hers, and although it was true that the monster was unable to move from his position, it was able to swing its ball and chain at the onlookers. The acolyte shrieked and others gasped as the cleric stepped in and casted Status Recovery on the undead. ""Everybody! Heal!"" The cleric shouted as everyone focused his or her healing powers towards the center, even Byakko. The monster fell back as it was bombarded by numerous heal bombs from every person inside. ""That...""The cleric said, between breaths. "" should never be tackled until you are 50 or higher. Unless you want to have broken bones all over, you best stay away from those types of monsters. The bully went in gasps as she stayed back in the group, traumatized by the ordeal. Heh, what a pathetic person... ""Byakko..."" The cleric called from the registry scroll. Byakko stepped forward as he held the piece of paper on hand, shaking faintly. Throwing the amulet on the ground, he waited in abated breath as a peculiar corpse rose. It was a zombie. Byakko knew that, but somehow it wasn""t in the tint of violet. It was more of the blue. Looking back at the cleric for confirmation to attack it, Byakko charged at the zombie with his 6 Chain, finishing the fiend in four strikes. No loot came out. The cleric gasped for air when he realized that the zombie was no more than smoke, disappearing in the air as the ground shook and a fissure formed in the center. Strange pentagram like symbols appeared on the crack as a very large demon-undead rose from it. It looked like a rotting sorcerer with a large aura and floating in the air. Dark Illusion. Byakko had studied almost all the known monsters of Rune-Midgard; and he was most fascinated in the area of Necrology and Demon Physiology. He had known and identified any undead and demon, whether existing in his time or not. Dark Illusion was no laughing matter. They were known servants of the Dark Lord, the undead MVP monster. And their spells are in almost comparison to their master. Byakko realized it was just too late when the creature shrouded him with his ghostly cloak, shutting him from the view of others. It felt like he was falling and falling into an unknown dimension. He landed with a thud on something like a transparent floor. There was no light around them, yet they saw each other; Dark Illusion and himself. The monster began his assault at the scared acolyte, realizing that he was no match for the demon.",583064
2975,"Bellaluna then replies, ""Oh no Heady, you should know by now that I refuse to make deals with demons, see where it got ""Gentleman"" Jim Craddock? Now he""s the Gentleman Ghost!"" Bellaluna then sees Fred the barber and asks, ""Hey I don""t remember freeing you!"" Heady then rolls up to her and says, ""Umm there""s a reason why some of the zombies, manjis, and Cajun Fox also freed him, and if I told you it would make you more freakier than this guy."" Fred picks up Heady and asks him, ""And what is that reason my shrunken head friend?"" Heady then mumbles and comments, ""Oh no, more guards, let""s beat it!"" And so she and her army continue to run and she comments, ""Oh I wish I had my hat but that darn puppy has it!"" By the time Bellaluna escaped Arkham, Batman drives the Batmobile to Arkham and managed to end the chaos with the help of the Red Tornado and Blue Beetle. Batman then asks the staff, ""Did anyone escape?"" Then the staff member answers, ""It was a unexpected plan made by Dr. Chien Bellaluna, she made it out of there, but we have no idea where Joker, Scarecrow, Riddler, and Mr. Zero went. And where is that freaky barber?"" Batman then says, ""I got to warn the dog, now that Bellaluna""s out of Arkham, there""s no doubt she will stalk him again!"" ((About 2 weeks later after the ""Yokai Castle incident"" of Somewhere Park)) A School Bus departs from the Somewhere Ballet School to a school that is a few miles away between Somewhere and Townsville. The School Bus drives through a road covered in mist and leaves being blown past the wheels. The Bus stops at a huge red building with a omninous nature to it. The name of the Establishment is ""Fusilli""s Elite School of Dance and Puppetry"". The Bus is parked near the school and out comes Dance Instructor Dee Dee. Dee Dee looks at the map and says, ""Yep, that""s the place, come on out girls!"" Out of the bus comes the students, Edna, Jenny, Rachel, and Edwina. Courage Jr. comes out of the bus and is a bit creeped out by the building. Edna then asks Dee Dee, ""Miss Dee Dee, why did you insist that I should being my dog with us?"" Dee Dee then responds to Edna, ""Well ever since the incident from 2 weeks ago, I feel alot safer if he and his little friend was with us."" Jennifer then blurts out, ""I told you so Edna, even Miss Dee Dee knows how I feel... hey wait, what little friend?"" Then suddenly Cheese, the youngest daughter of Chowder Sr. shows up in a ballet outfit but still wears her bunny ears hat. Dee Dee then says, ""No not that ""little friend"", I mean her!"" Then out comes a girl Edna""s age who appears as a young girl in a pink ballet outfit, white tiara, long purple hair, peach colored skin, and black eyes. Edna then sees the girl and says, ""Princess! What brings you here? And why do you still assume human form?""",910821
2325,"Now that he had a plan, Bruce removed his hands from his head and said, ""I need to get out of Gotham."" He looked up at his former protégé, ""Would you like to come with?"" Dick was shocked. Not just by Bruce admitting he needed a vacation, but that he""d been asked to accompany him on said vacation. His answer was almost automatic. ""Sure."" Now that a plan was in place, something deep inside of Bruce settled. ""I""ll make the arrangements. I""m thinking Tokyo first."" Bruce threw his legs off the bed, but kept the sheets around his waist, looking at Dick expectantly. But Dick was still too deep in shock to pick up on the prompt. So Bruce said, ""Dick, I""m naked under this sheet, and need a shower. You""re in my way, and I doubt you want to stay."" Yeah, Dick definitely didn""t want to see anything under the sheet. He hastily removed himself. Selina loved Gotham. The city had a heartbeat and a feeling that was unique to any other place in the world. Its citizens were just as unique, for better or worse. It was her home in every sense of the word. God, she would miss it. Ted Grant returned from the bathroom, as soon as he sat again he looked at the key she""d pushed across the table to him once again. He picked up the conversation from where they""d left it. ""Now let me see if I""ve got this straight. You""re giving me the key to your paid for penthouse because you""re leaving Gotham."" Selina was slightly annoyed by his disbelief. ""I didn""t realize moving was such a difficult concept for you, Ted."" ""I don""t believe it."" He slapped his hand on the table, drawing the attention of some of the more cultured patrons, and Selina thought she should""ve picked a less upscale restaurant for this as she briefly scanned the crowd for familiar faces. ""I just don""t fucking believe it."" ""It""s happening whether you believe it or not."" Selina smiled and Ted was as charmed by it as any breathing man. ""Well, I don""t want your place. It""s too rich for my humble and rough tastes."" Surprisingly Selina didn""t put up a fight, which made Ted suspect that she""d been planning for this to be his reaction from the start. ""Fair enough. Then just make sure no one goes into it and feed my cat for the time being."" Ted wondered if any of this had anything to do with Batman""s recent disappearance. The Dark Knight hadn""t been spotted in Gotham for over a month now. But he pushed the thought aside. ""Where are you going?"" Selina glanced at the surrounding crowd again. Jesus, she was getting as paranoid as Bruce. ""I think the less you know, the better."" Ted sat in disbelief for a moment more before slapping the table again, ""Well then, this calls for a drink."" He grabbed the passing waiter. ""Two glasses of your finest scotch for me and the lady."" Selina instructed, ""Just one glass, but I""ll take another lemon water."" The waiter nodded and went off to fetch their drinks, but Ted wore a confused expression on his face. ""Since when do you not drink scotch?"" Selina evaded the question, ""Since when do you care about my drinking habits?"" The waiter had returned with their drinks and Selina thanked him.",1497577
1259,"He caressed her hips, getting a good look at her, yet again. He assumed she wouldn""t last long. He would find interest in her and give up sooner, or later, then she would have to die. ""Oh yes... You""ll do fine."" He made a comical whistle, taking a step back and looking you up and down. ""What do you mean?"" ""I want you to help me kill the Batman. You work for Falcony anyways, it can""t be that much of a difference."" He walked over to the fudge and began rummaging through it, then looking through every cabinet he could see. She stepped over to the counter and leaned against it watching him shyly. The Joker was in her apartment and she didn""t know what to say. He turned to her pointedly, raising his hands. ""Do you have any booze around here?"" ""I-I don""t drink."" ""Hmm... Pity."" He removed his coat hanging it alongside hers on the rack and hopping over the couch to lazily lay there. He gestured for her to come over, patting his lap, she shook her head and he frowned. ""Am I gonna have to knock some sense into my beautiful Harley?"" It was a threat, but in the mildest manner. He was threatening her and even if she did know how to fight, she was no match for him. She crossed her arms and shook her head, keeping a blank expression she approached him and sat down on his lap hesitantly. He wrapped a possessive arm around her waist and pulled her into his chest. Raising his other gloved hand to caress his fingers through her hair. ""You have such pretty hair. Has anyone ever told you that?"" ""Yes."" ""What about these scars? They look pretty to."" She stood up against his arm, but he grabbed her wrist and yanked her down onto her knees in front of him. ""Please don""t."" She closed her eyes tightly to hide the tears, she couldn""t show weakness. Where were all these emotions coming from? She usually had none and somehow he seemed to bring them out in her, unlike any man before. Would it be save to say she was obsessed with the man? At Arkham she would check his file every day, sometimes pass his cell only to find he had been moved to another one. ""Shhh... It""s alright."" He caressed the side of her face. ""I need you. You need to be strong my little Harley. Let""s test something out."" She heard a loud click and opened her eyes to find a switch blade in his hands, the blade dangerously close to her skin. She struggled away, but he remained firm with his grip on her wrist. ""I looked at your file and God, you are a woman. After. My. H-eart."" He pronounced each word throughly, his eyes straying around here and there, before finding hers again. ""Why? What do you want me to do?"" She whispered to him, he brought the blade to her skin caressing it smoothly. He was going to make her rebound, make her snap. All those therapies she went through would be for nothing, feeling the blade on her skin, made her heart race in a way that was pleasurable. ""I want you to be my Harley. Why else would I be here? You..."" He was teasing now, pointing the blade at you before letting it hover over your skin.",6234395
158,"When she noticed that her son was not following, she stopped, ""you""re not coming?"" He sighed and shook his head. ""I can""t understand her anyway."" Kahoko looked surprised for a second but still she smiled guiltily. ""Miss Misa, I-I should be practicing, I know-"" ""Hush dear,"" the older woman patted the younger one""s shoulders. ""You can tell me if there""s anything wrong."" The smile slowly faded as Kahoko lowered her head, ""I can""t do it, miss Misa.."" she started in a small voice. ""You can""t..?"" She nodded. ""I can""t play as-as expressively as you do Miss Misa..I-I can""t..."" ""My dear-"" The younger woman shook her head, her shoulders trembling. ""I don""t know what""s missing-I just can""t..."" The pianist watched as the violinist clenched her fists in frustration. ""Kahoko dear,"" the pianist started after a long pause, ""have you ever been in love?"" Round golden eyes suddenly grew wide in surprise. The question was definitely not in the ones she expected to hear. ""What-?"" Smiling softly, Hamai Misa reached for Kahoko""s hand and pulled her to her feet. Her eyes twinkled. ""So, have you been in love, Kahoko dear? Is there a guy you consider special to you right now?"" There were many people she considered special: her family, her fellow participants in the concours, her friends-but, was Hamai Misa pertaining to that-the other kind of love? If she were in love that kind, wasn""t she supposed to act all heart-struck like Nao and Nami when they talk animatedly about the guys they like? Shouldn""t her heart beat like crazy at the mere thought? Shouldn""t she be blushing right now and stuttering like those heroines from Nao""s manga, as the face of that one man she ""loves"" surface on her mind""s eye? She contemplated fervently-- was this really going to help her playing? When the clueless expression on Kahoko""s face did not waver and instead developed to an expression of deep thought, Hamai Misa almost felt relief that her son was not in the room. One sided..? Smiling at the violinist, she settled herself on the piano. ""When you play, you create an image, a setting with your music. You not only express your feelings but you also pull your audience to feel the same."" She paused, making sure Kahoko understood. The violinist nodded. ""It""s the same with this piece. When I played it, I wanted you to feel the same as what I feel, to see what I was seeing."" The first few measures resounded softly. ""Did you know that this piece actually has accompanying lyrics? Not by Chopin but by Bob Russell in 1950."" ""R-really? I-I did not know that.."" Gradually flustering, Hamai Misa continued playing. ""I- This song is actually very dear to me. This-well, my husband played and sang this song to me when we were in Paris some twenty years ago."" ""We were quite young then, you know, just taking a leisurely walk on the streets of Paris one cold night."" Hamai Misa""s cheeks were already glowing red. ""And then he took out his violin and played this.. his.. his eyes never left mine as he sang-never caring that he sounded flat."" She laughed as the last notes fleetingly surfaced and disappeared.",560480
3407,"""No, I like much more ordinary men like you."" ""Gwen, believe me, I""m not ordinary."" Lara rolled her eyes. Here we go again... ""I... I didn""t mean...you...,"" Gwen said, getting the wrong meaning. ""I just like much more... ordinary men... Like you."" ""...Thanks,"" Merlin said, unsure if her words were a compliment or not. ""So! These truffles! Are they great or what?!"" Lara said in a bright tone, trying to change the topic. They were spared from answering when a horn sounded, announcing the arrival of the King. By some unspoken term the guests shuffled into position at the long wooden tables, standing to attention as Uther swept inside the hall, his brown cloak billowing behind him. His crown, an inch-thick piece of gold placed around his head, gleamed in the candlelight. He took his place in front of the head table, where Morgana and Arthur were also standing. Merlin and Lara stood in a corner of the room. ""We have enjoyed twenty years of peace and prosperity,"" Uther began. ""It has brought the kingdom and mysef many pleasures. But few can compare with the honor of introducing Lady Helen of Mora!"" Uther led a round of appaluse as he took his seat at the head table. Merlin jabbed Lara fiercely on her ribcage. ""That""s her!"" he said in a barely contained whisper. ""The one with the cornhusk doll!"" Lara studied this alleged witch with great interest. Her straight, brown hair was pulled into an elegant bun with lower layers cascading down her shoulders. Her dress matched the candles- a golden yellow with a white lacing. ""She doesn""t look at all threatening to me,"" Lara said stubbornly as the piano struck up with the first few bars of Helen""s song. When Helen opened her mouth to sing, a haunting, lulling melody issued forth; Lara didn""t know anything about opera but even she knew that this was pure talent. The words were in another tongue, but with the grim notes, she assumed it was about lost love or something- after all, weren""t all operas about that? By this stage, Lady Helen had stepped off her mini-stage and began roaming down the aisle, clearly loving what she was doing. Lara was beginning to nod off at this point; her eyelids were heavy, her head was drooping... ""Lara!"" Merlin hissed. ""Wake up, cover your ears-!"" ""Huh?"" Lara said, mind having gone foggy with sleep. With a huff of impatience Merlin grabbed her hands and jammed them over her ears, before doing the same to himself. Lara blinked the sleep out of her eyes and saw why Merlin had done it: everyone in the place seemed to be falling asleep. Heads were buried on arms, sleeping guests leaning on each other, even the King nodding off with his head in his hand. As Helen""s song grew more powerful, so did the enchantment. The candles suddenly went out, turning the room blue with moonlight; cobwebs appearing out of nowhere, covering everything and anything with glinting, silver strands, as though they were being strung by invisible spiders. The place resembled a haunted house. For a split second, Helen looked around, surveying her handiwork.",2855986
3161,"YES YOU HEARD RIGHT PUPPY DOG, DR. BELLALUNA USED HER MAGIC TO TELEPORT EVERY PERSON FROM THE CITY INTO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN OF TOWNSVILLE! Chowder Jr. then replies, ""Yeah, she teleported my family to Townsville just to protect them while I agreed to go with her since I""m the only one in my family to be a member of the Neighborhood Monster Watch.

Bellaluna rubs her head and asks, ""Then who""s ""The Stupid One numbers 1 and 2""?"" Shirley replies, ""Eustace Bagge and Edna""s brother Eric."" Courage Jr. then says, ""Well I guess we have no choice but to let Dr. Bellaluna join our group if she""s serious in getting rid of The Queen, but we can""t have Edna, Ebe nor the Killers join us since they are normal humans and normal humans are normally the types monsters would attack.""

Edna is saddened that she cannot join her dog since she is nothing more than a normal 7 year old human and a target for monsters.

530,"""Okay... so, my name has now changed to Lily Gillan-Shannon."" She paused. ""Ugh, sounds like I got married to one of you. Let me go change, I""ll be out in five."" She darted back into the house, not bothering to close the door. Josh followed her inside, knowing she wouldn""t care either way. He""d always liked the Gillan""s house- it always smelled like flowers, and since Lily was an only child, the atmosphere was actually quite peaceful. Pictures were dotted along the house here and there. They were mostly photos of the Gillans over the years. Josh looked at them for what felt like the hundredth time, and, as always, compared the one with a male member to the one without. His smile faded- that year, when Lily was five, her father had passed away. Lily didn""t remember much, and nor did he. When they were growing up, Lily often called Jim ""Uncle Dad"" for this reason. And then there were some miscellaneous pictures that sat on tabletops here and there. Some of them were from Lily""s photography classes, while some were ordinary shots of them making stupid faces. Sigh. Those were the good old days. ""Okay, let""s gooo!"" Lily declared, marching from her room. Her dress was a simple flowery prairie dress, but its effect was good. She grabbed his arm and they flew back to the Shannon house. ""There you are!"" Jim said, obviously relieved. ""My lovely wife as almost to the brink of killing us all,"" he joked loudly so Elisabeth could hear. ""Yes! I had the knife ready and everything!"" Elisabeth shouted back from the bathroom. Jim chuckled. ""Well, she decided on a few inside and a few outside and then we""ll be done."" A ""few inside and a few outside"" didn""t come nearly as close to what Elisabeth actually had in mind. She did a whole family shot inside, then pictures of everyone individually, and then the children together, and finally Jim and Elisabeth themselves. And then the entire process was repeated outside. ""Oh, my God,"" Lily moaned when she walked back to her house. ""Josh, I appreciate the thought and everything, but next time, don""t tell me when your family is taking next year""s pictures. I think I lost the ability to smile."" Sigh. This kind of thing happens every year at my house when my mom just declares that we must take Christmas pictures. Reviews are love! :) XX. AHHHH!

""Nine,"" she declared, and counted her car down the board. ""I""m getting married!"" She smiled and pulled a blue peg and placed it next to the pink peg in her car. ""I""ll name him Bob."" She settled back in her seat, feeling quite pleased with herself. Maddy spun the wheel next. Two.",2855986
2433,"the second agreed loudly, and I wished for some pit to open under my feet and swallow me. No such luck. They continued, unaware of my fervent desire for some natural disaster to strike. ""I like Miyazawa-san!"" ""Me, too!"" Then I felt it. The darkness stirred within me, and I gripped the desk tightly. Dammit, she wasn""t theirs. They had no right to embarrass her that way. I could see the heavy blush on her cheeks, and I knew that she could hear everything. Those damn idiots. One of them hit me upside the head playfully, and it distracted me from my brief surge of anger. ""Hey, all the girls are going for you!"" ""Damn you!"" the other teased. ""Haven""t any confessed yet?"" the first wanted to know, and again that blush covered my cheeks. I remained quiet, just smiling at them. It really was none of their business who had confessed their heart to me, and I wasn""t about to betray those girls. It took a lot of courage to share your feelings, and I respected them. ""Argh, dammit!"" the first one swore at me. ""I really should be upset at you!"" I blinked in surprise as the second one chimed in, speaking to the first. ""But it""s like you can""t dislike Arima."" ""You""re not as bad as another boy, you""re really incredible!"" The first one assured me. My smile became more genuine, but the tension in Miyazawa""s slender body bothered me. I would have been embarrassed to hear myself spoken of in such a fashion, and I couldn""t blame her. Still, when I saw her after school that day and tried to apologize, she shrugged it off. ""Miyazawa-san?"" I called, trying to get her attention. She was seated at her desk, organizing her notes as was her habit immediately after class. I straddled the seat in front of her desk, so I could face her. ""I just wanted to apologize for this morning..."" I began. She was silent for a minute before she capped the messy pen she preferred and looked up at me. ""It""s okay,"" she assured me, before giving me the gentle smile I had come to expect from her. ""I""m used to it. Didn""t you see the love letters I got this morning?"" she asked. ""Yes, but..."" I began. I really wanted to apologize to her. She reached out and touched my hand briefly, her smile unflagging. ""It""s really okay,"" she assured me. ""It""s flattering to be liked, I guess,"" she said, though her tone wasn""t entirely sure. ""Do you ever accept any of the invitations?"" I blurted out suddenly. She blinked at me, before a secretive smile found her lips. ""Do you?"" she retorted. ""No."" ""Neither do I,"" she said softly. ""Why not?"" I asked. She looked thoughtful as she packed her bag. ""There""s a few reasons, but I suppose the main one is because the boys who ask me aren""t really interested in Miyazawa Yukino. They just want to make their friends jealous."" ""You really believe that?"" I asked in disbelief. I was surprised that she was so cynical. Her smile faded from her lips. ""Sometimes. People always want what others covet,"" she said. ""What about you?",1112924
2087,"Willy groaned and pushed the button to let his father into the factory. ""How can I argue with that?"" he gave Anastasia a kiss. ""Now, come on. Let""s go see him,"" Anastasia said, dragging Willy out of the room. Out of frustration, she picked him up over her shoulders, which surprised Willy. ""You""re strong!"" he commented. ""It comes from having to lift and climb so much."" Anastasia said, back perfectly straight as though Willy were no more than a sack of flour. ""Okay, okay. You can put me down now."" Anastasia put him down. Willy stuck his tongue out at her and they kept walking. ""You""re such a baby."" she muttered. ""But I""m yours."" Anastasia cracked up laughing, as did Willy. ""Never did grow up, did you?"" Willy and Anastasia jumped out of surprise. Willy""s father stood, watching them. Willy crossed his arms over his chest and looked at the floor, but Anastasia came up to Willy""s father with no shyness. ""Hi. I""m-"" she started to say, but he cut her off. ""I know. I saw the two of you on television. Are you really from the streets?"" he asked, giving Anastasia a disgusted look. ""Yes."" Anastasia said, unabashed by the statement. ""I""m not surprised."" the man said, giving her a sneer. Anastasia could see the anger that loaded Willy""s face. ""Not all of us are as fortunate to have parents that are so concerned for our health, sir."" Anastasia said. Willy was surprised at how casual her tone was: it was as though she thought he was the salt of the earth. ""I suppose not,"" he said, then clearing his throat, ""I got your invitation. Which one of you sent it?"" Willy refused to say anything. ""We did, of course. Why would you go to someone else""s wedding?"" Anastasia asked. ""Because-"" but Anastasia cut him off. ""Well, I suppose you would if it were your own, or a good friend""s or a relatives, but why on earth would you miss your only son""s? Goodness, that would be so sad. But aren""t you thrilled? You get to be a grandpa!"" Anastasia made the oompa loompa call, and one of them, having heard the conversation, went to retrieve Rose. Rose was quite heavy for the poor little oompa loompa, but he was strong. Anastasia thanked him and took Rose. ""Once we""re married, Willy will adopt Rose, and and it will be as good as blood."" Anastasia said. Willy""s father""s glare softened at the sight of this baby, with her round face and tuft of golden hair. Her dark eyes looked up at him curiously. ""Would you like to hold her?"" Anastasia asked. Before he could say another word, she handed Rose to him. At first, he looked a little scared, but Rose laughed at him with her sweet baby smile. Willy felt a stirring of jealousy. Someone else was holding his baby! HIS BABY! Anastasia, sensing Willy""s hot anger, placed her hand gently on Willy""s shoulder. ""Don""t be upset. It""ll be okay,"" she whispered. He gave her a frantic look and she put her arm around his shoulders. Willy pulled himself together long enough to offer his father a guest bedroom, which his father gratefully took. It was late, so they were all about to go to bed anyway. ""All right, Willy, let it out.",870118
450,"A good night,"" I mumbled standing up. ""Did you ever think maybe that""s not it? That maybe what he truly wants is a companion, or love.

""Has he reached out to you,"" Popescu asked fearfully. ""More than reached out, try thrown a book at me and Matt several times, not to mention grabbed my hand and kis..."" and that""s where I left my sentence hanging noticing Matt listening intently. ""HE WHAT,"" Matt shouted jumping up. ""Seriously Matt, he""s a ghost,"" I murmured looking at Popescu for help. ""Matt, if he""s reaching out to her that""s good,"" Popescu replied standing up as well. ""How is it good, when a dead guy is kissing your girlfriend,"" Matt yelled. ""It means she can figure out what he wants and give it to him. Once he gets what he wants then he""ll move on, well hopefully,"" Popescu answered. ""I know what he wants, and I""m not dying just so he can have me,"" I whispered, but Matt caught it frowning. ""Well all I know is that if you find out what this ghost, Jonah, wants then it""ll be much easier getting rid of him. However, I must be off. I have to be somewhere, so if you guys need me again just give me a call,"" Popescu smiled before giving me a hug and shaking Matt""s hand. He then headed over to his car and left. Matt and I headed on over to his car and jumped in. Once we were on the road again things became very quiet until Matt spoke up. ""I can""t believe you let him kiss you,"" Matt groaned as he leaned his head against the window all the while driving at the same time. ""It""s not like I could have done anything Matt. He had a hold of me, and tell me how you""d feel if some ghost grabbed your hand when you just finished showering and you just stepped out stark naked. I was completely caught off guard. It scared me,"" I yelled over at him forgetting to mention the naked part before. ""NAKED, HE CAUGHT YOU NAKED,"" Matt yelled jumping up in his seat as the car swerved ever so slightly into the other lane. ""Matt remember you""re driving a car please,"" I screamed holding onto the handle. ""Oh sorry, NAKED,"" he screamed looking over at me. ""Yes, I said I was in the shower and he grabbed my hand and I jerked open the curtain, well...you know the rest. He leaned in and kissed me, but the lights flickered and he was gone. I was still standing there stunned before I realized what had just happened,"" I replied looking over at him. Matt was huffing and puffing and I could tell he was really upset, and just the irony finally got to me. I began to giggle, before bursting into laughter.",806976
2991,"Rooms behind locked doors, gaps in the floor plan for missing rooms but no doors, normal household items were placed in places where they normally wouldn""t be found. Lamps were found under beds, inside desks and outside windows where it was either the reflection of something he couldn""t see or it really was floating just outside, beyond his reach. All the windows were solid, none of them could be opened and it just so happened that all the creepy, ""floating lamp windows"" were the ones that weren""t broken. Although the air around him remained calm, he could almost sense something in the air around him. A breeze rushed by him, yet at the same time he could not feel it or hear it. Only his mind ""recognized"" the rush of wind that called to him. The hallway remained perfectly still, quiet and calm, except for that odd wind sensation. The more he followed that strange sensation, the worse he began to feel. Strange as he felt, he could feel an overbearing emotion wanting to control his body. The emotion he felt was so strong that he couldn""t even tell what emotion it was, just that it was making him physically sick. Everything in his mind pulled at him to leave this place, pleading with him yet the further he walked towards the pain the smaller that voice seemed to get. Calling out for Tsuzuki wasn""t an option but the thought had crossed his mind more then once as of late. The more he walked away from the exit, from the staircase down to the lower floors the more dreamlike everything began to feel. Maybe it was from a lack of sleep, or stress or nothing at all, but the world around him started to feel different. His body wanted to move of its own accord and the more he struggled the stronger his bodies determination was to follow that mysterious, powerful emotion. It was here, the final door in the upper hallway. What lay beyond it.... +Continue+ Summary: Hisoka still doesn""t trust Tsuzuki, but when Muraki kidnaps him it seems that his partner is now his only salvation. A cursed tattoo, the red moon, and the magic rope made of witch hair that holds Hisoka""s life in the balance. If Muraki had a sense of humor, it was probably one of the most sadistic and twisted one in existence. Then again, Muraki had never been quite ""with it"" to begin with so any stunt he pulls, it usually wasn""t a surprise. Evil and demented yeah, that was Muraki""s up and down but it would never be considered ""surprising"". A long time ago, that guy once placed a curse upon Hisoka, causing him to eventually grow weaker and in any event, become a shinigami. The one thing that Hisoka still carried with him, were the mystical body tattoo which could only be considered a sign of branding. Though it only came out during times of extreme emotions or distress, the fact still remained that it wasn""t going away any time soon. It was also fact that Muraki had a bigger interest in Tsuzuki then his partner, everyone knew, however that it didn""t mean much between the two of them.",583994
73,"And the line went dead. I stared at my phone, eyebrow raised. That man had to be the strangest person I""d ever... not technically met yet. But it was done. Zen had no idea I was already on the way to his place. Then, as if that thought had summoned him, my phone went off again. ""Ah, you picked up right away, jagiya~! Did you miss me?"" My heart beat like a drum. Whether from general nervousness, my anxiety, or talking to him right after my call with Luciel, I didn""t know, ""H-hi, Hyun."" ""Ah? You sound a little... off,"" His voice dropped in that way it did when he was worried, ""Aya, everything okay?"" ""Yes, yes!"" I said a little too quickly, ""Sorry, just finished practicing some dancing. I""m a little tired."" The lie didn""t roll off my tongue quite as smoothly as I""d""ve liked, but after a moment of silence Zen appeared to buy it, ""... I would have loved to have seen that."" ""Well, I could dance at the party, you know,"" I said offhand, thankful he hadn""t caught on to my lie. ""I""d want you to dance for me, just me,"" I shivered at his tone. It was even lower, somehow light and husky at the same time, ""I looked up that dancer you mentioned. If I ever saw you dance like that... ahh, it would be hard to control myself, jagiya~!"" I rolled my eyes, ""You""re making me sound like some high-end dancing beauty, Hyun."" ""Well, you are."" My shoulders sagged, ""Says the man who has no idea what I look like."" ""Then tell me."" I blinked, ""What?"" He laughed, ""Describe yourself to me, since I can""t see you."" ""Um..."" I looked out the window again. I was still a bit from his house and had to be careful so I didn""t ruin the surprise, ""Dirt brown hair, blue eyes, stick thin with a chest disproportionate to my frame, shoulders too square, and a cleft chin. Just an ugly American, really."" ""I don""t believe you,"" He laughed, ""That was the most self-deprecating description I""ve ever heard."" ""You""ll see at the party, I guess,"" or in five minutes. But he didn""t know that. The limo was getting close, so I hastily added, ""I""ve got to go, Hyun. Errands to run at um... The college."" ""Hmm... Why do I get the feeling you""re hiding something, jagiya?"" He chuckled, ""But alright. I""ll talk to you later, Aya, my sweet~."" I said goodbye and hung up, unable to keep the deep blush off my cheeks. I""d known sweet talkers before, but this man took the cake. I held a hand up to my burning cheeks and switched on the chatroom, only to see Zen railing against the ""sudden dozen cat pictures"" making his nose itch. I laughed, and the limo slowly came to a stop. The divider to the driving cabin slid open, ""We have arrived, Ms. Aya."" ""I uh... Thank you, Mr. Kim,"" I rubbed the fabric of my skirt, suddenly feeling self conscious. I was here. Looking out the window of the limo, I saw his apartment building. It was much smaller than the 15 floor downtown monstrosity I lived in. There were these little bushes around, and a door leading downward. Zen""s apartment was half basement, so I guessed that""s where I needed to go. The limo door slid open and Mr. Kim stood back so I could climb out.",748687
3788,"Linda was working the grill today, so Dawn was running around like crazy taking orders to people. She didn""t seem to feel very good, but she pushed herself anyway. He noticed that she was pale in the face. Then, a familiar scent caught his trained nose. Wafting through the crowds, the scent of sin came to him. When she passed him again, he inhaled deeply and an image came to his mind. He was kneeling to pet Squishie. He realized that he was seeing the world through Dawn""s eyes instead of his own. It felt strange to be in a female body. Then, the two thugs closed in. The familiar fear and recognition of them flooded him. He tried to run, but they captured him. One of them held a knife to her throat, the other one raped her. He was pinned helplessly against the wall as the assailant slammed into him over and over, causing his womb to scream in pain. Tears fell thickly, but he said nothing. It had happened before and it would happen again, he knew. Then, through his own eyes, he saw himself approaching the alley after Squishie had ran off. He saw himself smacking first one in the jaw, then the other just before he blacked out. It wasn""t Dawn""s sin he was smelling. It was her attacker""s. Apparently, they knew each other. And now, she was pregnant and she didn""t know. That made him cringe for some strange reason. It hadn""t been her fault, but he wondered why on earth she hadn""t gone to the hospital to take care of it. He""d heard of women having abortions before and they weren""t condemned for it if they had a good reason, such as health problems. The laws on that had been unclear as well. He noticed that she was disappearing a lot. She was probably having morning sickness. He didn""t know why, but he started taking the orders out to the customers while she was gone. When Dawn returned, she was surprised to find that most of the customers had already been served. Despite the strange tension that always existed between them, she gave him a grateful smile and he found himself returning it for some odd reason. Right then, a note appeared on the counter. He recognized his father""s scratchy writing immediately. Congratulations, kid. You thought of someone else before yourself. I""m impressed. P.S. Watch out for Blaze. Here he comes. His expression darkened slightly as Blaze came in the door. He hoped that Dawn would take Blaze""s order. Blaze sat down at one of the tables. Dawn went over to him with the little notepad in her hand. Blaze looked up and smiled. Blackheart scowled when Dawn""s face flushed slightly. He wondered what the Ghost Rider had said to make Dawn beam so much. She wrote down his order and laughed at something else he said. Squishie also seemed to take to Blaze and he was now scratching behind her ears. Dawn came back towards the kitchen. Blackheart couldn""t suppress a smirk as she filled one cup with jelly beans. What kind of a pansy eats jelly beans out of a martini glass, anyway? He""s not that tough, Blackheart thought, remembering Blaze""s old habit. The other cup was coffee laced with a variety of flavorings.",870118
1985,"In just a few short days, Ana will turn seven years old. Then she will be old enough for the Abbey of the Everyman to take her in. As much as I""d rather not do this, I think it""s the only future she""ll have. I can""t bear to have her turn into one of those street-corner prostitutes, nor can I bear to imagine her as a common laborer, heavy with child, unable to get enough to feed herself let alone several more hungry mouths. She is a very outgoing child and her beauty is already starting to show. It won""t be long before the men take notice of her. I know her mother dislikes this idea with a passion-she""s been very vocal about not wanting to send Ana away. But again, we have no choice. The other thing is this imaginary friend that she can""t bear to part with. She used to always wave her little hands at something neither of us could see or hear. When she grew older, she filled her room with drawings and paintings of a man with black eyes. At first, we thought she""d overheard someone talking about the Outsider and decided he""d make a good playmate for her little games. There aren""t many children around this area for her to play with, after all. But the way she speaks...it""s beginning to sound too much like she has an acquaintance with the real thing. If so, the Overseers will have her one way or the other. I""d prefer that she was on the right side of the mask. Ana closed the journal. I can""t read anymore... ""Why didn""t you tell me?"" she demanded, but only the wind answered. Frustrated, she shoved the metal box and its contents into her traveling bag. So either you can""t tell me or you just won""t... She looked at the empty shrine when she returned back downstairs. There was still no sign of The Outsider. Am I boring you? Is that it? Or are you trying to get me to go somewhere else now? She left the house. Though she""d been feeling very sick earlier from the smell, she had gradually gotten hungry without noticing. Now her stomach wouldn""t shut up. She felt weak and thirsty as well. I have to find food and water and a place to stay that isn""t crawling with rats, she thought miserably, I won""t have time to think about all this if I""m dead. A gurgling moan followed by a shuffle jerked her out of her lamentations. Another Weeper, this one a man, had caught sight of her and was rushing forward eagerly with outstretched arms. Ana""s heart began to pound. Another one...dammit... She looked up at a balcony. It was too far for her to jump, but just maybe.... WHOOSH! The Weeper""s arms seized only empty air where she had been a second before. Ana was now on the balcony. She began to laugh breathlessly as the poor Weeper looked around, confused, before resuming its depressing trudge along the filthy sidewalk. I suppose that""s one way, she thought, looking at the faintly glowing mark on her hand, if they did board up all these buildings to make them inaccessible from the ground, that means I could have a place to stay if I could just keep the rats out. And I know for a fact it wasn""t just the poor who caught this dreadful disease.",870118

""Sam! Come on don""t be all sad, this is why we""re here... to have fun, which is something you haven""t been having since Harrison--"" Sam glared at Brooke. ""Don""t bring him up. I told you I don""t want to talk about Harrison"" Brooke shrugged. ""Well it""s the truth.

""Fine, let""s just get this over with"" Brooke smiled big and dragged her a few more feet before stopping. Sam looked over Brooke""s shoulder to see a handsome guy; he was 6""1, he had short brown hair, intense brown eyes and all the right curves. Sam smiled. ""Sam this is Alex, Alex this is Sam"" Sam stumbled but managed to catch her balance when Brooke pushed her towards Alex; Sam glared at Brooke over her shoulder and then she turned to Alex and shook his hand. ""Hi Alex."" Alex smiled at her; *A cute one* ""Hi Sam. How are you enjoying the night?"" Sam opened her mouth to say something but scowled when she felt someone push her; Sam looked up at Alex and shook her head. ""Could be better. Sorry this isn""t my thing, the only reason I""m here is because my friends made me come."" Alex laughed and flashed Sam a smile. ""I know how you feel, this is so not my scene, I""m more of a book person if you ask me"" Sam smirked but winced when she heard the music get louder. ""Want to go up to my room, to talk"" Sam hesitated. ""I--- well--- I don""t know"" Alex put his hands up. ""Just to talk. Believe me the last thing I want is *that* thing you""re thinking about. Just some good, well rounded conversation"" Sam smiled. ""Then lead the way"" [Meanwhile Outside] ""This has to be the most idiotic plan ever! I told you we wouldn""t be able to get in, and oh yeah that little secret handshake Josh---"" Harrison turned to Josh who had a embarrassed look on his face. ""Was pure genius! I mean hey who wouldn""t believe that? Those guys have to be idiots not to believe that"" Harrison folded his arms against his chest; He was already regretting this... the only reason he had come here and sat next to George the whole car ride here was because there was a chance he could see Sam, and the fact that horny college guys who had no good intentions except to use them would be surrounding Sam all night made him uneasy. ""Well I for one, didn""t see you coming up with anything Harrison"" Harrison turned and glared at George; god this guy had some nerve, after all that had happened between him and Sam, George talked to him like they were best friends or something... which they were not.",29783
1350,"""Not really,' he answered, ""My mother""s kind don""t need much sleep. Thanks for defending me, by the way.' ""No one, even a prince, has the right to insult either myself or those I love,' she said, laying her head on his shoulder. ""Are you sure of your feelings for me, Princess?' Magnus asked, ""We""ve only known each other for a short time.' ""I""ve never been more sure of anything in my life,' she said. ""I love you Magnus, and I want you to stay with me.' Behind the couple, a solitary sniff, and a heart that ached with bitter sorrow lay listening with his mind. His secret power hidden from even the strongest magic wielders. Suddenly, cracks in the earth opened, and sand began to pour into the cracks. The breaks widened, and long, clawed hands reached up for the surface. Their master spoke to them through the wind, ""Kill the others, but leave the Princess alive.' ""Magnus!' Gem said, pointing to the hands, ""Do you see that?' ""I do!' he said, drawing his dagger. He leaped to his feet, and yelled, ""Alarm! Alarm!"" The others jumped up from their slumber, grabbing their weapons (or looking for a hiding place in a certain Grass Runner""s case) and they stood together, to face the creatures under the burning sands. The monsters that arose were gruesome indeed. Eight feet tall, three horns protruding from their brows, and tongues a mile long hanging frothier limp jowls, acidic saliva dripping to the ground. ""Kill them all,"" they growled, ""Leave Princess. Feast on Manflesh!"" they lunged and snapped their razor sharp teeth at the heroes. Magnus whirled around and kicked them away from Gemini. Orson stabbed one of them through what he assumed was it""s heart, but the thing kept coming. ""These things aren""t alive!"" Orso cried. ""That makes it easier then,"" Magnus said, slicing off one creature""s arm, ""If we can""t kill them, then we""ll just have to hack them to pieces."" ""Killin""s killin"" by my book,"" Gerrek said, chopping three creatures down the middle. Behind him, Ryna chopped and severed the heads of many sand monsters, while Greebus and Elska used magic to blast the beasts apart. ""This is a little too easy,"" Rayna observed. During all this, as Gem partook in the hacking, she heard the wind whisper across her ear. ""Princesssssssssss,"" it hissed. ""Who goes!' she cried in her mind. Then, she felt choke her throat. ""You have spirit, little Princess,' the voice that owned those said. ""But you cannot your destiny. You cannot escape me. I will have you, I will have Lodoss! You are mine..."" ""MAGNUS!' she cried in head. Magnus turned from the creatures, and sprang to the air. He saw the Princess on her knees, clutching at her own throat, struggling for breath. ""Gemini!"" he cried. ""Spirits of the Wind, silence this dark power which speaks through you. Release this girl from your spell!"" Then, the hold on Gem""s throat let go, and screamed away into the night, just as the last sand creature was decapitated. ""Gem?"" Leaf asked. ""Princess!"" Maar said, distraught, running over to her. ""Magnus, what happened?"" Elska asked.",512464
2385,"He caressed the side of her face. ""I need you. You need to be strong my little Harley. Let""s test something out."" She heard a loud click and opened her eyes to find a switch blade in his hands, the blade dangerously close to her skin. She struggled away, but he remained firm with his grip on her wrist. ""I looked at your file and God, you are a woman. After. My. H-eart."" He pronounced each word throughly, his eyes straying around here and there, before finding hers again. ""Why? What do you want me to do?"" She whispered to him, he brought the blade to her skin caressing it smoothly. He was going to make her rebound, make her snap. All those therapies she went through would be for nothing, feeling the blade on her skin, made her heart race in a way that was pleasurable. ""I want you to be my Harley. Why else would I be here? You..."" He was teasing now, pointing the blade at you before letting it hover over your skin. ""My dear, are going to be my... What""s it called..."" He brought the blade up to his lips and tapped it thoughtfully there, his mind off looking for a proper name. ""Groupie."" He blurted out when the answer was clear, a present smile on his face, the blade was back at her wrist. Her mouth dropping open and her teeth grinding at the fate waiting on her, his cut would make her insane. ""Like all those celebrities have Groupies, I will only need you. You will be my Harley. We can have so much fun together."" ""Why?"" ""I""m sure Batman doesn""t go around looking for sidekicks and beautoful broads to throw over his shoulder. This way I will have you, I will have something..."" He leaned downward, elbows on his knees, the knife slowly began to cut. Her breath hitches and she let out a heated moan. ""Violent."" He ground out in a animalistic tone. She moaned his name when the blade carved deeper into her skin. He chuckled, removing the blade, he threw it to the side and bringing his mouth to lick up the blood dripping down her wrist. When it was gone, but kept profusely running from the fresh wound, he licked his lips looking up at her. ""Yes. I""ll do it."" She only said yes, because she wanted to help him. She had shot someone before so that wouldn""t be hard, but keeping his attention would, staying alive would deem difficult. ""Perfect. Now go get dressed in something you think I""ll like and bandage up that wrist."" She stood and left the living room doing as he instructed, she didn""t really have anything he""d be interested in. She bandaged up her wrist, going though her closet afterwards, she found something. It was originally something her friend got for her so she could show off to her boyfriend. It was pretty much stripper wear, but it was her favorite colors red and black. A bright red ballerina like skirt that was poofy at the ends. Long fishnet black stockings that went down into leather boot heels that zipped up to below her knees. Black Lace went down the sleeves from the red sports bra that fit very tight to her breasts and showed off her flat stomach. Fingerless black gloves, she put her hair up into pony tails and to appease the Joker.",6234395
44,"Hisoka snickered, ""I could never be mad at you."" His smile, however quickly turned into his normal, worried expression. His face couldn""t hide the distraction he felt in his mind. ""Muraki... I know him. He""s up to something and I can feel it."" Tears stained his face as those same, strong gentle hands tried to calm him down again. Tsuzuki had gotten good at remaining calm around Hisoka, and he knew his partner was glad for it. ""I know it hasn""t been that long since you""ve recovered somewhat, but... boss has a mission for us."" Tsuzuki""s voice was full of hesitation and fear, the uncertain realm in not knowing where to tread on a delicate subject. ""Muraki has been up to something, but we don""t know what. He wants us to check out if he might have... left anything behind for us at the mansion. He wanted you to go too, in case there were clues there only you would be able to recognize."" ""When,"" a short, emotionless response. ""When you""re ready. It""s not pressing, but I wanted you to know."" ""Yeah,"" Hisoka pulled himself closer to Tsuzuki""s chest, his hands were lightly shaking from nervousness. Not one to admit his own insecurities that easily, he looked for comfort in the only person he knew he could count on. ""It""s time to go try mixing in with the crowds again,"" Tsuzuki""s voice was soft, ""I know its hard, but I swear I""ll protect you."" A sigh escaped Hisoka""s lips. Tsuzuki was talking about the ""training sessions"" in the realm of the living. They were trying to slowly introduce Hisoka to other people of various sizes, not only to help his mind sort out the insane emotion overload thing, but also to help cure him of the fear he seemed to retain for people in general. Hisoka""s voice seemed frantic, pleading and out of character for him. ""Tsuzuki, I... We don""t have to go up there, right? Can""t we just skip it for today and stay here, together? Please? We have lots of time to-"" Tsuzuki paused Hisoka""s talking with his finger, a worried look matched his feelings. ""Don""t be afraid, Hisoka."" Tilting Hisoka""s head up towards his face, ""I""m right here, okay?"" A gentle kiss locked Hisoka""s attention towards his partner, and also calming his nerves down immensely. The only person he didn""t seem to be afraid of, was his quirky partner. The park during the middle of the afternoon on a weekday was usually pretty sparce. Those who weren""t working either had the day off, or probably never had a job to begin with. Slightly cloudly and with the sun peaking through, the day all in all, wasn""t too bad. Hisoka felt like a clingy child at the moment, holding ontoTsuzuki""s arm like the sky was falling. Tsuzuki, however, just responded with gentle touches for silent encourgment. He wasn""t sure if he would ever get used to the new feelings he felt from strangers, but there was always hope. ""I wonder why Muraki did this? Why... Why did he-"" Hisoka was stoped by a gentle shushing motion. ""Focus on the task at hand, okay? What do you feel now?"" Tsuzuki scanned the area, two people in the distance, and another dog walker on the other side of the path.",583994
894,"As Carlotta moved her things into the main dressing room and pushed and bullied Senior Fetine around, she endured Gaucinii""s insults.

""I don""t know, do you shine that ball you carry on your shoulders? Oh, forgive me, that""s your head."" The string section suppressed giggles as Gaucinii""s face and neck folds turned red. ""Excuse me, I need to stretch my legs,"" Celeste said. As she went out the door, she couldn""t help but feel like she was being followed. She looked over her shoulder, but didn""t se anyone. She hurried on up the small staircase out into the backstage area. Suddenly, she heard a crash, and spun around. Sprawled and struggling to get up was a young boy, couldn""t be more than sixteen years old. He had run into a pile of props. Celeste, and three stagehands went to untangle him from the jumble. ""What happened?"" one of the men asked. ""I- I was just leaving to get some fresh air,"" said the boy. Celeste helped him to his feet. ""You look familiar,"" she said. ""Oh, I""m nobody,"" he said nervously, as the stage hands left them. ""I""m just another member of the band, you might say."" ""Everyone""s someone,"" Celeste said. ""You certainly are, Miss Diamond."" he said, smoothing his short, red hair. ""Well you know my name, what""s yours?"" she asked him, holding his arm. ""My name""s Pierre,"" he answered, ""I am not that well known, At least not like you,"" ""What do you play?"" Celeste asked him. ""I play in percussion, Actually, that""s not all. I""m supposed to play the tympani, But I dream of writing symphonies,"" and he blushed as he added, ""I also like to write stories."" ""That""s wonderful,"" Celeste said, delighted and surprised that a writer was hiding in their midst. ""What kind of things do you write?"" ""Well,"" Pierre said, ""I know people are very keen on Gothic novels, or operas set in Italy or France or England, but... I like to write about other places."" ""Like where?"" ""Like America,"" he said with enthusiasm, ""Or Russia. And Japan! Oh how I would love a tale from Japan. And... Unless I am mistaken, your name is Japanese, yes?"" She laughed, ""Yes, it is."" ""Then, are you? Truly?"" he asked with hope in his eyes. ""Sort of,"" she answered. ""I""m actually half French, too."" ""Oh how romantic!"" he exclaimed, looking at her, ""I can picture it: An enchanting French maiden, taken in by a Samurai Lord, and-"" ""Stop, stop, stop,"" she said, waving her hands in front of him, ""Get your head out of the clouds. My father was French."" ""But, I thought-"" ""It""s a long story,"" she said. ""Oh,"" Pierre said, looking at her with big puppy dog eyes. ""I would love to hear it."" ""Out of my way!"" Carlotta bellowed as she stomped through the backdrops, coming on them like a terrible pink gale. ""Someone send-a the Rice Girl and this-a snively child out of here."" the red head commanded a pale looking man in spectacles.",512464
106,"What kind of plan were they talking about? Had they set me up for something? Oh, did I know so little... Leon and Chris stopped playing and the orchestra picked up again. It was a nice waltz, but seemed somehow familiar. I tried to find my way out of the crowd, but only succeeded in getting tossed around a lot and ending up more confused then before. Then a hand fell on my shoulder and I jumped, swinging around to run right into someone in a dark SeeD uniform. I looked up at felt like I would combust from embarrassment. Mitsuru had a hand on my shoulder and was chuckling lightly at my antics. I tried to pull away, but his grip tightened. ""C... Commander Leonhart?"" I asked formally, looking up at him in confusion. ""Mitsuru,"" He said simply, ""My name is Mitsuru, Sera. Now... would the best looking girl here care to dance with me?"" Dance? With him? But there""s no way that Heather had danced with him yet, and since she is the next Sorceress and he the next Knight, is was customary that they share the first dance at all balls. Is this what the others had planned? My eyes widened and I couldn""t help but let a little gasp escape as the full realization of their ploy hit me. My dress was short and cream, not that complicated. Mitsuru wore his SeeD uniform, as did the rest of them (except me). This is the SeeD Inauguration Ball. The song playing is Waltz to the Moon. They had planned this... no likely going to the stage to signal the orchestra to start playing. And now here I was, in Mitsuru""s arms, with him asking me to dance. I just stared, somewhat dumbfounded, until he repeated his question. I shook my head, looking down at my feet, ""I... I can""t though. I don""t know how to dance."" ""Weren""t you taught in school?"" He asked, his smile widening even furthers. ""I was bad at it; I have two left feet..."" ""It""s okay, come on."" ""B-but-"" ""It""s all in the leading; you""ll be fine!"" Mitsuru pulled me through the crowds to the middle of the ballroom. When he stopped, I ran into him, causing a chuckle to escape the Commander. He turned around and directed me where to put my hands, cutting off any objections I had. Mitsuru put one hand on my waist and the other in my own hand. Once done with that, he smiled reassuringly down at me, ""Okay then, just follow my lead."" I wasn""t joking when I said I have two left feet. He chuckled every time I started apologizing profusely for stepping on his feet or every time I tried to run away he would always pull me back. We ran into a few couples, who were mad at first but upon seeing who they had just run into, began apologizing to Mitsuru instead. We were getting stares from people, and I suddenly felt self-conscious about the whole thing. What was I doing here? My face was beet red, my pulse rate through the roof. I could feel my heart beating against my ribcage, as if it would suddenly burst out. For every mistake I made, Mitsuru was there to reassure me and get me to try again. He kept at it, and I noticed that the song was being played again. Heather""s doing, no doubt.",748687
2514,"The brown eyes met with the blue with a startling clarity, a dawning realization- she just wasn""t sure what. It was an odd feeling, a warm one, a fond one, a passionate one... her heart sped up beyond belief as he leaned in closer to her, his lips, the lips she found herself wanting on her own, only two inches away- ""Well? Have you set it up yet?"" Doc asked, completely unaware of what was going on behind his television set. They jumped back, startled. Elle hadn""t realized that Doc had come in. ""Eh, yeah. Here it is, Doc."" She stood up and went around to the front, next to Doc. Marty stood on his other side. ""Never mind that, never mind that now. Not now,"" an older, black-and-white version of Doc said on the TV. ""Why, that""s me!"" Doc exclaimed gleefully. ""I""m an old man!"" ""Good evening. I am Doctor Emmet Brown, I""m standing in the parking lot of the Twin Pines-"" ""Thank God I""ve still got all my hair!"" Doc interrupted his future self. ""What""s that thing I""m wearing?"" ""That""s a radiation suit,"" Marty replied, hitting the fast-forward button on the video camera. ""Radiation suit?"" Doc repeated. ""Of course. Because of all the fallout from the atomic wars."" Doc stood up and his attention shifted to the video camera on top of the TV. ""This is truly amazing,"" he said, picking it up. ""A portable television studio. No wonder your President""s an actor. He""s got to look good on television."" ""Hey, wait, this is it, Doc,"" Marty said, gently pushing the camera back to the TV again. He hit the play button. ""-this sucker""s electrical,"" Future Doc was saying. ""But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts-"" ""What did I just say?"" Doc asked. Marty rewound the tape. ""-electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the 1.21 gigawatts-"" ""1.21 gigawatts!"" Doc exploded in disbelief, running both of his hands through his white-blond hair. He wandered away by the DeLorean. ""1.21 gigawatts! Great Scott!"" He disappeared through a door. Elle was afraid he might have a stroke. ""Doc-!"" ""What the hell is a gigawatt?!"" Marty demanded before running through the door after them. ""How could I have been so careless?"" Doc was saying. ""1.21 gigawatts! How am I going to generate that kind of power?"" he grabbed his framed picture of Thomas Edison. ""It can""t be done!"" ""Come on, Doc, drink some water..."" she coaxed him, handing him a Dixie cup. She took the picture and but it back on the mantlepiece. ""Doc, all we need is a little plutonium,"" Marty told him. ""I""m sure that in 1985, plutonium is available in every corner drugstore, but in 1955 it""s a little hard to come by. Guys, I""m sorry, but I""m afraid you""re stuck here!"" Doc held his head in his hand, looking like a child who had just gotten spanked. ""Whoa. Whoa. I can""t be stuck here! We can""t be stuck here, we""ve got a life in 1985! I- I got a girl!"" Marty said, his voice cracking. Doc sat up. ""Is she pretty?"" Marty sat back. ""She""s beautiful, Doc. She""s crazy about me. And look-"" he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a crumpled piece of blue paper. He flattened it on his knee and held it up for Doc.",2855986
1955,"""My fault! They attacked me. How am I the bad guy,"" my brother began as I pinched him hard in his side trying to tell him to shut up, but it didn""t really work well, because after a yelp, he turned to glare at me. ""You""re fault,"" she yelled now drawing his attention back to her as she pushed him back closer to the ground with her bow, taking me with him. ""Hey, whoa,"" my brother said trying to calm her now, afraid that I""d get hurt. ""Your fault,"" she cried again just as angrily ignoring his words, ""You""re like a baby, making noise, don""t know what to do."" ""Easy, fine, fine..."" my brother said as he stood up, while she began to pull back the bow. Helping me up the best way he could with one hand he went on to talk, ""If you love your little forest friends, why not let them kill my ass?"" ""What""s the thinking,"" I added now finally speaking to her as she turned her eyes on me, with slight surprise. ""Why save you,"" she asked making sure that""s what we meant. ""Yeah, yeah, why save us,"" my brother asked her as she ignored him, but at the same time still took his words to heart as she kept her eyes on mine, looking with curiosity at their crystal sky blue features. Finally with an emotion other than anger or blankness she spoke kindly while looking between me and Jake, ""You have a strong heart...no fear."" That brought a twinge of a smile to my face; however she came closer as the irritated look came back to her eyes. Focusing on Jake she replied, ""But stupid... ignorant like a child."" With that she turned and began to make her way through the lighted path. Laughing wryly Jake looked at me as if to prove that he wasn""t, but I held the same frown she did, his laughing died away as he picked up his staff, and took after her replying, ""Well if I""m like a child, then uh...look maybe...you should teach me."" Following closely behind I heard her reply. ""Skypeople can not learn: you do not see."" ""Well then teach us how to see,"" I said trying to speak to her as well now. ""No one can teach you to see,"" she threw back to me a little bit nicer. ""Whoa,"" I heard my brother say as suddenly his eyes caught what was under the large root we were standing on. Down below was a long drop, with a creek, and waterfall beneath. ""Look, come on, le...Can""t we talk? Say, where""d you learn to speak English,"" Jake asked as we tried to keep up with her on the branch, well more so Jake. I could have done just fine. Being a gymnast when I was younger helped a lot here, ""Dr. Augustine""s School?"" Right about then Jake tripped losing his spear as it fell below into the large stream, while it took the both of us to get him before he fell off as well. ""You""re like a baby,"" she growled getting frustrated, as she said a few Na""vi curses. Fuming my brother with the best puppy dog face he could muster said, ""We need your help."" She turned to look at him and that""s where the stare down started. ""You should not be here,"" she spit out as she waved her hand in front of his face to show emphasis.",806976
2390,"If he gives her the money she says she is going to donate it to charity."" Roman was glaring at her as their lawyer""s bickered back and forth. They didn""t say a word, her gaze unwavering and strict. She was back to being that less confident shy girl that she was before. It was rather odd for a divorce to be about giving more than taking, half the things the lawyers were arguing about were mostly issues on who would accept what and why not. Lina looked down at her lap and fiddled with her thumbs. ""What about the condo he is giving her?"" Her eyes perked up and her eyes shot over to meet his lawyer""s. Her lawyer was about to say something, after all they had discussed that whatever he offered her, she would not accept. But this was different. ""Condo?"" ""Yes. His condo in California. He wants to give it to you."" She looked back down at her lap, unsure of whether or not she was doing the right thing. Then she glanced up to meet Roman""s eyes, he pulled a cigar from a box on his desk and put it between his teeth. Not once breaking her gaze. ""No, I can""t accept that."" ""Why not?!"" Roman spat, growing impatient with the fact that she wanted nothing from him. She asked nothing of him anymore. She didn""t say anything back and instead looked down at the back of her fingers. The one with the ring was still there, she wouldn""t dare take it off earlier. She gradually slid it off her finger, Roman sat up and reached across the desk to place his hand on her shaking ones. To prevent her from taking it off. ""Don""t."" He warned past the cigar hanging from his mouth. ""That you will keep."" It was an order and she slid the ring back on her finger and nodded. She would let him have that much, it would make him crazy knowing that she didn""t have something to remind her of him. She noticed that he hadn""t taken his ring off either, he probably would never take it and for some reason that warmed her heart. He pulled his hand away and dropped back down into his seat. ""Um... Lina wants to offer you something as well. It is small, but I suppose it is substantial."" The lawyer lifted up his suitcase and opened it, pulling out an orange envelope and placing it on Roman""s desk. Roman shoved his cigar into its tray, it was hardly half way finished. He picked up the envelope and ripped through it impatiently. When he saw the image of a tiny fetus inside, he nearly broke down, the first time he would have in his entire life. ""It was a boy. You told me you didn""t want to know until it was born."" His eyes went back up to hers and he took a deep breath. She was smiling slightly, but tears were on their way and she was forcing them back. ""Why are we doing this? If you want me to treat you right, I can do that."" Her smile disappeared and she shook her head. ""You say that every time."" Roman kept his lips shut after that. ""Can we continue?"" She said to her lawyer and he did. When it seemed like everything was finished, they were to sign something of their approval. Roman mindlessly scribbled a line and pushed the document away.",6234395
70,"I can already tell you that he won""t say yes, even to me, but I""ll bring it up. [Jumin Han]: And you underestimate the power you have over that man, even after only seven days. [Aya]: ... Excuse me? [Jumin Han]: Never mind. When and where should I have Driver Kim pick you up? There was something giddy to this conversation now. I could feel anxiety and nervousness mixing in the pit of my stomach, but something else overpowered them both. Excitement. But I knew that neither Luciel nor the elusive V wanted the apartment address to get out, and I wasn""t too keen on anyone knowing my address just yet either, so... [Aya]: Um... there""s a cafe a ways from the apartment. Here""s the address; *pastes link* Is that alright? [Jumin Han]: Yes that""s fine. Time? I can have Driver Kim there in an hour. I looked at the time on my phone. I didn""t really know how long it would take to get to Zen""s, so looked that up first. Should I tell him I was coming? It was sudden, and he""d see it the moment he went into the chatroom, but... That new giddiness inside of me kinda liked the idea of it being g a surprise. [Aya]: How about eleven? I can get there for lunch. [Jumin Han]: That works well for my schedule. Driver Kim will be instructed to pick you up at that cafe, then chaperone you during the visit at Zen""s. The idea of a chaperone for two adults was odd, especially for my American sensibility, but I have the okay. I remembered Jaehee""s words about protecting Zen""s reputation, so it only made sense. I guess. Zen probably wouldn""t like it, though. But none of that really mattered at this point. I was going to see Zen. In person. Suddenly, nervousness and anticipation flooded me for the first time in years. I was a hurricane, running here and there trying to find something to wear, what to bring, thinking about what to say... This was unlike me, but I didn""t care. I felt odd, renewed in a sort of way, and it reminded me of high-school. Before I""d met him and began my life in darkness and hell. This... As I stopped my furious running around to get ready, my eyes were drawn out the window into the clear, sunny summer morning. This was... happiness? I""d forgotten what that felt like. Author""s Note: See what I did there? Starting the weave aspects of the other storylines into one. Yoosung""s getting a kitten, and Jumin being an asshole to poor Jaehee! (Seriously; Jaehee is such an adorable character. I love her.) Next time... Meeting Zen! Chapter Four Jagiya ""Patience is not sitting and waiting, it is foreseeing. It is looking at the thorn and seeing the rose, looking at the night and seeing the day. Lovers are patient and know that the moon needs time to become full."" - Jalauddin Rumi The cafe was quaint, run by a jolly old grandmother-type named Jangmi. I""d been here once, my first day in Korea, and it was just delightful. While waiting for Jumin""s driver, I ordered a chai tea latte and a little sweet croissant. The summer day was cool for once, the first glimpse of fall maybe, and the tea warmed me right up.",748687
623,"""Just sit back and watch the master."" A couple of sparks flew out of the back of the TV and Marty pulled his hand back. ""Ow!"" ""What""s wrong?"" ""Damn thing shocked me."" ""...Do you need any help now?"" Marty looked at her and gave a resigned sigh. He nodded. Elle leapt up from her perch on the couch. ""Move,"" she elbowed him out of the way and took a look at the wires in the back. ""So what don""t you get? ""See, I""m not sure which wire goes where. If you put the wire here, the image is a little fuzzy..."" Marty crossed a wire to another. Elle leaned over and looked at the screen. ""I see it,"" she said before ducking back behind it again. ""But if you put it here-"" Marty crossed it again- ""Everything-"" ""-becomes clear,"" she finished with him. She looked at him. The brown eyes met with the blue with a startling clarity, a dawning realization- she just wasn""t sure what. It was an odd feeling, a warm one, a fond one, a passionate one... her heart sped up beyond belief as he leaned in closer to her, his lips, the lips she found herself wanting on her own, only two inches away- ""Well?

3053,"But as he walked in with her, she looked him over as he looked for a clerk to help them, and she couldn""t help but wish there was time. She wanted to berate herself, after all he was still a relative stranger, but she couldn""t help but feel...something for him. Even if it was just lust. It felt like more than lust though. Olivia looked around the shop in an effort to distract herself from her thoughts. It was much as she would have guessed, with leather gloves and outfits all around. There were straps and belts lining one wall. Glove lining the other. Racks of jackets, pants and other items filled the store with a rack of shoes in the back. On the other side of the back were some dressing rooms. She looked up and saw a familiar eye in the frame of the sunroof which provided the store with natural light. A man came up to them. ""Can I help you two?"" ""Yes,"" Jacques answered for her. ""The lady here requires an outfit for a trip upwards. And we""re in a terrible hurry."" The man nodded as though he understood, taking out a measuring tape. Within seconds he had taken her measurements, astounding Olivia with his speed. She looked to Jacques who gave her a reassuring half-smile. The man left them for a few moments before returning with a catsuit and some boots. It wasn""t an outfit Olivia would ever wear, but then she had never imagined herself joining a secret organization either. She gulped down a bit of nerves looking to Jacques once more. He gave her an encouraging nod, then pointed to one of the changing rooms in the back. ""I""m sure it fits perfectly, but you might as well change here."" She wondered where else he would consider her changing. In the back of his cab? She made her way to the changing rooms, and after swallowing once more, knowing they were in a hurry, she changed as quickly as she could. The suit did fit perfectly. She studied herself in the mirror, forcing herself to admit she looked quite good. Though the glasses didn""t look right. She went to her purse where she kept a pair of contacts in case of emergency. While this didn""t really qualify, she decided it would be worth it. Jacques"" eyes took in her figure as she stepped out of the dressing room. She walked towards him in her heels, her eyes never leaving his. ""What do you think?"" ""I think it""ll do nicely."" He held up a credit card, turning to the clerk. ""We""ll take it. To go. Be a good man and be quick about it."" ""Yes, Mr. Snicket."" The store clerk collected the tags and began to ring the purchase up. He even collected Olivia""s old outfit to put into a bag for her to carry out. Jacques was looking at her again, this time he licked his lips once before telling her, ""You look very nice, Olivia Caliban."" Rather than blushing, Olivia""s heart pounded and she walked a step closer to him, clearly making him a bit uneasy though he didn""t step away. ""Thank you, Jacques Snicket."" It was the first time she""d said his name and from the twinkle in his eye, he quite liked it. They had not gotten lucky in the penthouse. Or at Veblen Hall.",1497577
3218,"Now she was on top of him as she struggled to pin his hands. He simply wrapped his legs around her and spun her on her back making him on top. Alex suddenly let go of one of her hands and pulled out a rope striking fear suddenly in Jamila""s mind. ""What are you doing,"" Jamila said as she began struggling more and more to escape. ""Taking you prisoner,"" Alex smirked as he grabbed her hands and got them behind her back and tied them. Jamila suddenly kicked him hard in the balls and he rolled off of her and clutched at his family jewels. ""I really hate it when you girls do that,"" Alex groaned in pain. Jamila smirked and tried to break out of the bonds, but found she couldn""t. She tried to use her powers, but found that useless as well. It couldn""t be could it? They had blessed the ropes to hold her. She growled in frustration and suddenly found herself on the ground as she continued to try and break them. Before she knew it she had Alex over her again tying her feet. She tried kicking at his face, but it didn""t work as he pushed her legs down. Once he was done he threw her over his shoulder Tarzan style and began to run back toward the air balloon. Jamila noticed the others doing the same. It had been their plan all along to do this. She screamed out toward Imhotep who began running after them, but it was to late they were already in the balloon flying off. If it hadn""t been for the fact that she was in the balloon then she knew that Imhotep would have done something. Her mother ran after the balloon at first screaming her name, but Imhotep stopped her and pulled her away. Jamila turned her hateful eyes on six pair of triumphed ones. They were screaming and yelling in triumphed as she set there and whispered as many curse words as she could under her breath. If it wasn""t for the fact that she""d end up injuring herself in the process she would have brought this machine down herself with a sandstorm, but then again she couldn""t. The bonds they had used wouldn""t let her. ""Oi you idiots what now,"" a black man called from the wheel as he looked at her with lust filled eyes. Men! She hated them all. ""Now we wait, and then we""ll make a trade. They need her do they not Ardeth,"" Rick asked looking at Ardeth curiously. ""Yes, we wait. They""ll need her sooner or later, but for now, just keep an eye on her,"" Ardeth said looking down at Jamila. ""Do not underestimate her,"" Ardeth said and then finished, ""It might be the last thing you do."" Jamila was about to blurt something out at him when suddenly Alex put tape over her mouth so she couldn""t talk. He gave her one of his famous smirks and a shrug as he walked off toward the group on the other side of the balloon. Jamila sat there alone and just closed her eyes and leaned against the side of the machine. Now all she had to do was pray that her parents came up with an idea and got her out of this mess. Why did she have to say those awful words? They always made bad things happen. ""How much messed up could her life get?' if only she had kept her thoughts to herself, she thought angrily.",806976
265,"""He was too swift for me, little sister,"" Kikyo said, ""But, yes, for now he is gone, Keade."" ""Then come with me, sister,"" she said, leading Keade up the stairs. ""We will get our sacks and go to Naoto""s farm to pick up the rice for the shrine."" Meanwhile, the white haired half demon sat in the trees above, watching the priestess. He had watched her for less than a year now, trying to learn her moves so he could get the Shikon Jewel. He had been seeking the Jewel since autumn, when rumor first reached his ears that it was near by. He wasn""t impressed by this Kikyo. She seemed like any human he""d seen. He""d first seen her when she was attending some wedding ceremony in early fall. She did not look like a person who could protect a Jewel. But then, he stuck around and watched her. He remembered once, he had been scrounging around during winter. It had been snowing. And he saw her coming from river. She was covered in snow, and carried a bundle of hay over her head. He had watched her go into a solitary hut that lay far from the village, and come out again with nothing but a blanket wrapped around her shoulders. He had looked through the window of that hut later. The family inside was cooking fish, and the father had his arm in a sling, and they were saying praises for Kikyo and her act of kindness to them. Then, later when he had seen the hole in the icy river, and no fishing line in sight, he figured out that Kikyo had stuck her bare arms into the river and got that family food when the would have starved otherwise. But now, he saw a regular human woman running off with a skinny little brat. ""Some ""protectress""."" he mumbled as he leaped back into the forest. For several weeks, their encounters were like this. The white haired half-breed would try to steal the Jewel, and Kikyo would chase him away. Amid this, Kikyo had to fight other monsters. It was becoming a strain, now that summer was near. One day, she did not see the white haired one anywhere near the village. She hoped he was gone for good. That day, she went to the river to get water, her sister coming with her. She had told Keade that it was not safe to go into the forest alone, but Keade said that since she would be with Kikyo, there was no worry. But as Kikyo dropped a bucket into the water, she heard her sister scream. She turned, and saw her sister running from a demon panther. The beast had a horn sprouting from it""s brow and three eyes that glowed blood red. And it""s fangs were as wide as Kikyo""s arm. ""KEADE!"" Kikyo screamed. She had no time to get the bow, she rushed the beast and grabbed around the neck. She clung to it as it thrashed and snarled and tried to scratch at Kikyo. ""Sister!!"" Keade shrieked, ""Sister Kikyo!"" ""Run Keade! Get help!"" Kikyo screamed back, but even as the child began to run, they heard a voice from the trees. ""IRON REVER SOUL STEALER!"" and the white haired half-breed jumped from the trees, his claws slashing at the panther""s face, taking out one of it""s eyes. The panther threw Kikyo from it""s back and pawed at it""s face.",512464

It was a rough night...and I haven""t had much sleep...that""s all."" Rei looked away, shamed in his behavior. Yuuya sensed the humiliation, and saw Rei looking down at his hands, reflecting. ""You always taught me to stay away from you...I can only be your friend if you want to; but you can never be mine if I asked. Have you forgotten? You told me to stay away from you...that I should never touch you. I took it by heart, Rei...and when you did offer your friendship to me, I accepted without hesitation. Wherever you go, I go...I can""t ask you to accompany me to places I want to, so I never did."" Rei listened, understanding started to dawn on his face. ""I can only stay behind you...not by your side. I can only follow, but never go forward before you...It""s how much I respect you, Rei. So, everything that you""ve been doing for me...for the past few days has been quite a shock for me."" ""Was that it? The cause of your delusions?"" Rei asked cautiously. ""No...those were my reasons. I""m really sorry I made all of you worry...I just wasn""t able to hold all of my emotions back..."" Yuuya spoke softly, a lump forming in his throat. Yuuya gazed back at Rei, who had grown silent over time. Yuuya grew uncomfortable, not used to seeing Rei this silent. ""Yuuya..."" Rei hitched, before coming in close and embracing the blonde tightly. Yuuya had been paralyzed, surprised when Rei suddenly brought himself on the blonde. Rei embraced him comfortably, neither possessive or loosely. He rested his head on the crook of Yuuya""s neck and made soft sighing sounds. Yuuya closed his eyes and returned the warm embrace back, unable to resist the moment. ""Yuuya..."" Rei whispered. ""...Don""t think of yourself like that. You""re also a human being...one that can love and be loved. Don""t stand as a pet and as a guard. You have your own right and dignity. I wish you not to remain as my shadow...but as a friend."" Yuuya felt tears in his eyes; relieved to hear the things he never thought to hear. ""I never thought of you like that, Yuuya. I always thought of you as a friend, as someone I can trust to share my thoughts and feelings with. You mean so much to me...more than what you can imagine. Always remember that..."" Rei held tighter, Yuuya felt the gentle pressure of that hug. ""Rei? Are you okay..."" Yuuya drew Rei back, when he felt warm liquid flow from his shoulder. ""You cried..."" ""Silly you...look at what you made me do..."" Rei scolded him, then laughed a bit. Yuuya smiled, finally understanding his role in Rei""s life. ""As a friend..."" Yuuya whispered, Rei resuming his duty of serving Yuuya for the day. He""d felt this was the day he""d never forget... Oh wow...I never thought I""d make Rei cry on Yuuya""s shoulders. I""ve been watching too much Samurai X, and this is what I get.",583064
1456,"Andy looked at him curiously, but all the same she got dressed and they walked up to the garage where they got in Andy""s car that she had let John borrow to get to work everyday. ""Where are we going,"" Andy asked. ""You""ll see,"" John said with a smile as he pulled out of the garage and started heading down the dirt road through the woods. ""You want to listen to some music,"" John asked looking over at her. ""Wouldn""t mind it,"" Andy said a little grumpily as her stomach starting churning a bit because of the baby. John turned on the radio and began to sift through the channels and soon landed on one song called, ""Headstrong,"" by Trapt. Andy smiled; she had always loved this song. ""Now whose the mind reader,"" Andy said looking toward him a smile. ""I might have looked through your stuff in your car when I was having lunch one day,"" John said smiling. Andy shook her head and said, ""Your evil you know that."" John looked at her and said, ""Baby I wouldn""t be in the brotherhood if I wasn""t."" Andy shook her head as they finally hit the road and pulled off on to it. They drove for a few miles before they hit the highway and then they pulled off onto it. ""So are you going to tell me where we""re going now,"" Andy asked. ""No, I told you it""s a surprise,"" John said laughing as Andy smacked him. ""You""re a smartass you know that,"" Andy said. ""I enjoy being one,"" John said snickering. Andy laughed as she rolled her eyes. The car fell quiet as in drove on finally hitting a few towns. Andy soon realized where the car was heading. It was heading in closer to the city, until John suddenly took an unusual turn. ""Where are we going,"" Andy asked again. ""Ask that one more time and I""ll turn this car around,"" John said doing a mother impression. Andy laughed as she looked out the window and then it hit her as they drove up and into a building. John found a spot in the garage and parked. Andy looked at him closely, but he just shrugged at her and smiled. John quickly turned off the car and got out and walked to her side and helped her out. ""Why are we here,"" she asked noticing the sign said ""Aquarium"". ""Because I was talking to one of my coworkers and he said that when his wife was pregnant that he took her here and it instantly calmed her nerves. Lately you""ve been a little up the wall so I thought this might help,"" Andy blushed. He was actually doing something really creative and nice for her. Andy leaned over and kissed him on the cheek as they got in the elevator. John smiled and kissed her back. As the elevator ascended Andy couldn""t help, but feel somewhat nauseous due to the sudden movements. John smiled and held her close comforting her. When they reached the top Andy couldn""t help but let her mouth form into an ""O"" form. The place was amazing and they hadn""t even reached the big tanks yet. There was already a guide there waiting on a few people and when she saw them she quickly ushered them in and took a head count. ""I think we have enough now. So let""s start our tour,"" she said with one of those happy tones that you pretty much knew was fake.",806976
1165,"""Check it out. Am I awesome or what?"" Charles tossed the crumpled yellow notebook to Joe, who scanned the pages. ""You actually turned that firework idea into a plotline?"" Joe asked, puzzled. ""Yeah. Figured we could use a romance. Haven""t made one in a while,"" Charles shrugged. ""Oh, by the way, do you know how to make people look presentable? Like, makeup-wise, I mean."" ""Uh, yeah. I think. Why?"" ""Amber- aka Elle- has to be really pretty. Like, really. I want people to feel for Rob- Cary- and why he loves her so much."" ""Point taken. I""ll probably have to go to the library and look up some methods, I""m more accustomed to zombies,"" Joe grinned at Charles, handing his notebook back. Joe felt his chair suddenly move. ""What the-?"" He looked down to see Alice squeezing herself under the table. ""Don""t ask,"" she said. ""Nyah nyah! Can""t get me!"" she said to Cary. ""That""s alright, just make sure it""s really good,"" Charles said, completely ignoring Alice. ""Hey! Hey! Shitheads!"" he looked under the table, where Cary was trying to pull Alice away. Both looked up. ""Yeah?"" they said in unison. ""Are you guys doing anything Saturday?"" ""No,"" they chorused. ""Hey!"" they said again to each other. ""Stop doing that!"" ""Hey!"" Charles snapped his fingers. ""Meet me at five on Lookout Hill on Saturday, okay? I want to get a shot of the sunrise in the background for my new movie-"" ""Five in the morning?"" Cary""s mouth fell open. ""Not cool, man."" ""But you""ll get to blow shit up..."" Charles wheedled. ""Can I set off my M-80?"" Cary asked excitedly. ""Whatever you want. So you""re coming?"" ""Mint."" ""Guess I""ll have to,"" Alice nodded assent. ""Cary, remember to ask Elle about that acting job, okay?"" Charles said seriously. ""Yeah, yeah. Quit nagging."" And their fight resumed. Ahhh, poker. OTHER GOOD CARD GAMES: Spit, Spoons, B.S., Blackjack, Slapjack, and Egyptian War. ""Ape-out"" means go crazy, in case you didn""t know before. ""Remember, ask Elle to be Amber in our movie, and give her the script-"" Charles reminded Cary for the hundredth time that morning. ""I know, Charles. Jeez."" ""Whatever. Good luck anyway."" Charles left him standing in front of Mr. Dunn""s door. Shaking his head, Cary went inside. The room was alive with chatter, which was surprising, because usually everyone was half-asleep in the morning. He caught sight of Elle, and his stomach gave a little lurch. What was that? He shook his head vigorously, trying to clear his mind. For God""s sake, you""re just asking her if she can act. Stop wigging. Cary dropped his bag in his chair and sifted through it, searching for the script. ""Dammit."" He pulled out crumpled bits of paper, rubber band balls, a used firecracker, homework he""d never turned in- ""The Sea of Decay,"" someone said behind him. Cary nearly jumped out of his skin and swiveled around to see Elle, grinning at him. ""Oh, it""s you,"" he said. ""What""s that supposed to mean?"" ""Nothing. Sit."" He patted the desk next to him. ""So- er- I was wondering- can you act?"" He deliberately buried his face in his bag so he wouldn""t have to look at her. ""No idea. I""ve never tried it. Why?""",2855986
3610,"This time, it was Eren""s turn to flinch. ""What kind of feelings?"" he pressed, as he turned his head to sideways to look at her. Though Mikasa""s gaze was still on the sink. ""The same feelings Armin felt for Annie."" Mikasa answered, as she turned her head sideways as well to face Eren. Much to her surprise, their distance wasn""t that far, and their current distance was awkwardly close. Dangerously close. Eren didn""t say anything nor did he move. He simply stared at Mikasa""s eyes, as if telling her something. Unbeknownst to the two childhood friends, their other friend had already left them alone after wiping the tables. Though there was another presence peeking by the kitchen""s doorway. Squad Leader Hanji peeked at the kitchen""s doorway carefully, not wanting to be seen. She was looking-more like observing the two soldiers who were currently in an awkward position. Hanji""s train of thought was disrupted when she felt someone behind her. ""What the hell are you doing, four-eyes?"" Levi asked, arms crossed. ""I""m doing a recon."" Hanji replied, as if the answer was so obvious. ""We only recon on titans, not on two hormonal brats trying to unravel their sexual tensions."" Levi said as he scrunched his nose, probably in disgust with Hanji""s creepiness or the two cadets"" little moment. Either way, Levi found the two quite weird. ""That was oddly specific. Anyways, look how Eren is trying to figure out what to do next. So adorbs!"" The brunette squad leader retorted, peeking back at Eren and Mikasa. ""That""s it. You creep me out. We""re going back. Erwin said we""re having a meeting."" The corporal said as he grabbed Hanji""s collar and dragged her towards the exit. ""Using the chatroom, right?"" she asked, not minding being dragged. ""That""s what he wanted, yes."" ""Then let""s go~!"" And with that, the two superiors fled the scene and once again left the two soldiers to their business. OMG what is Eren going to do?! I""m sorry I""m such an EreMika shipper ;A; They""re kinda my main ship as of the moment so I can""t help iiiiiiiiit. Don""t worry though. I won""t smother you guys with fluff. This fic""s main genre is humor and I plan to stick with it. (But still! EreMika tho hnnnnnnnng) Anyways, so as Hanji said, it""s time for the superiors to have a chatroom of their own! I wonder what they""ll talk about. Hihihi. You guys might want to leave a suggestion for any of our characters"" topic in a chatroom! I would love to hear from you~ Anyways, see ya""ll at the next chapter. Peace out! Hey doods! Happy Halloween ;) I gotta admit though, this chapter is full on EreMika. So I inserted chat messages that would add some comedic content~ And I must say, Eren is a bit out of character. I did my best to make him stay in character though... So uh... hope you enjoy this oh-so weird chapter. Eren and Mikasa stood in front of the sink, both just looking at each other and not moving nor saying anything. Eren was thinking of phrases- no, words to say, anything just to break the silence that overcame them. At the same time, he was wondering what Mikasa was going to do.",2750536
2996,"If not for himself, for Tsuzuki, for the only man in this world he felt he could trust. Hisoka kept his hands covering his temples but wanted more than anything to Tsuzuki""s arms holding him gently; a physical act that told him, ""yeah, there""s still one person in this world that loves me - and he""s holding me right now."" Just like that, Hisoka found Tsuzuki""s arms tightly around his chest. The soft whispers to calm him down floated upon his ears with a familiar voice. ""Shh, Hisoka. Calm down first. Relax your body and give yourself to me. Remember what I told you?"" Hisoka nodded hesitantly, waiting for Tsuzuki to continue. ""Don""t fight your memories and don""t force yourself. Trust in me completely; with your body, mind and soul. Feel me, right here, right now. I will remain calm no matter what you say. I will remain calm, and so will you."" Those same silent tears were running down his cheeks again, but unlike before he wasn""t upset over a nightmare, acting like a frightened child. Hisoka hadn""t felt such love before, love directed towards him. That did frighten him, but it made him very happy at the same time. There was something being able to stare so deeply into the night sky. The more Hisoka calmed his breathing and let his focus slip into a gentle lull, more and more he felt as if the outside world was slipping itself into a black void leaving just two people behind. No one else, besides the stars and the moon; he didn""t see the windows or hear the sound of cars and people that just two floors below them. The bad neighborhood, the passionate voices from the walls and those old, unsightly factory buildings around them disappeared with everything else into the night. Taking a deep breath, and focusing on the sound of Tsuzuki""s breathing near his ear gave him courage to maybe, just maybe be able to accept what had happened to him. ""That man..."" Even the sheer mention of Muraki""s name by proxy had him wanting to fight the memories and scream out against the world. But that wasn""t right; he had to think only of that beautiful white moon and Tsuzuki""s warm breaths on his neck. ""Back in that... horrid mansion, I remember that Muraki had me tied to a wall like a crucifixion. Sharp witches"" hair covered every part of my body; even though I was dressed I felt the hair dig into my skin like knives. There was so much blood, my blood draining to the floor. He... did things, even though I was tied up he still did those things to my body and... and I-"" Hisoka""s felt his voice start to shake uncontrollably causing a fresh pain to develop in his body. Tsuzuki never said a word, but Hisoka felt him everywhere now. Everything felt warm, and when he thought of that the shaking panic stopped. The night became longer and longer still as he stared blankly at the moon. His mind was beginning to panic the more he remembered, so he let Tsuzuki show him the way to redemption. There was no rush to talk about it, the world would be the same no matter how much time has passed and in that aspect and they really did have all the time in the world.",583994
1021,"He didn""t though, and when the scoring came, he sat in front of the screen with the others. Neither District 12 tribute scored higher than a five. He wasn""t surprised. Effie looked disappointed, but to her credit, she replaced the small frown almost immediately with a smile. ""Well, the scores aren""t that important anyway. Anyone up for some cake?"" It was a lie. He knew it and so did Effie. A bad score meant no sponsors, so unless you had a strategy or were incredibly lucky, you were now dead. He said nothing to the children, letting them enjoy their treat. Might as well enjoy their last meal. They""d only worked together for a year, but Haymitch was already a familiar person in Effie""s life, or at least it felt like it. She recognized that the scoring was the only time Haymitch could be counted on to be sober or paying any real attention to the tributes. She had been hoping for another little lesson this year, but these kids scored lower than the last ones. They probably wouldn""t make it out of the first day""s bloodbath. She shook her head, dismissing such negative thoughts. Effie would see to it that they were treated as equally as the other districts. They would be as prepared as she could make them. When the first day of the Games arrived she handed a flute of champagne to Haymitch. He had just woken up, so he looked at the glass as though he didn""t know what it was. ""What""s the occasion?"" Effie looked to the designers who were sleeping again. She set their glasses on the table in front of them. ""I thought it would be good to start a new tradition. We shall toast the first day, which will hopefully lead to a celebration on the last."" Haymitch drowned his glass in one swallow. Effie frowned and as she refilled it, she explained, ""We are supposed to toast first."" ""I""m all for more drinking, Effie,"" he downed his fresh glass as quickly as the last one, ""but this is a stupid plan."" Effie ignored him, filling his glass again. ""It""s not a plan. It will be a tradition. And who knows, maybe it""ll bring our tributes luck."" This time Haymitch waited. Effie lifted her glass, she bit her lip and looked to the designers. Haymitch said, ""If we wait for them, it""ll be the end of the Games before you get your toast."" A chuckle slipped out, but Effie repressed it quickly. Haymitch grinned, pleased to find that the escort did in fact have a sense of humor. She raised her glass, ""To victory and good odds."" Haymitch added, ""To death and stacked decks."" Effie didn""t like his added negativity, but they clinked glasses and downed their drinks before sitting down to watch the opening ceremonies. Both kids had died on the first day, and Haymitch had found himself in the bar that evening. Chaff still had a girl in it, so he was talking with sponsors. Part of Haymitch wondered why his friend bothered, but he was also envious that Chaff still had that much hope. He downed another whiskey. Haymitch had lost all of his so long ago. ""Is this seat taken?"" Haymitch closed his eyes, unwilling to look at the other man, ""Aren""t you busy right now?",1497577
3372,"He removed his coat hanging it alongside hers on the rack and hopping over the couch to lazily lay there. He gestured for her to come over, patting his lap, she shook her head and he frowned. ""Am I gonna have to knock some sense into my beautiful Harley?"" It was a threat, but in the mildest manner. He was threatening her and even if she did know how to fight, she was no match for him. She crossed her arms and shook her head, keeping a blank expression she approached him and sat down on his lap hesitantly. He wrapped a possessive arm around her waist and pulled her into his chest. Raising his other gloved hand to caress his fingers through her hair. ""You have such pretty hair. Has anyone ever told you that?"" ""Yes."" ""What about these scars? They look pretty to."" She stood up against his arm, but he grabbed her wrist and yanked her down onto her knees in front of him. ""Please don""t."" She closed her eyes tightly to hide the tears, she couldn""t show weakness. Where were all these emotions coming from? She usually had none and somehow he seemed to bring them out in her, unlike any man before. Would it be save to say she was obsessed with the man? At Arkham she would check his file every day, sometimes pass his cell only to find he had been moved to another one. ""Shhh... It""s alright."" He caressed the side of her face. ""I need you. You need to be strong my little Harley. Let""s test something out."" She heard a loud click and opened her eyes to find a switch blade in his hands, the blade dangerously close to her skin. She struggled away, but he remained firm with his grip on her wrist. ""I looked at your file and God, you are a woman. After. My. H-eart."" He pronounced each word throughly, his eyes straying around here and there, before finding hers again. ""Why? What do you want me to do?"" She whispered to him, he brought the blade to her skin caressing it smoothly. He was going to make her rebound, make her snap. All those therapies she went through would be for nothing, feeling the blade on her skin, made her heart race in a way that was pleasurable. ""I want you to be my Harley. Why else would I be here? You..."" He was teasing now, pointing the blade at you before letting it hover over your skin. ""My dear, are going to be my... What""s it called..."" He brought the blade up to his lips and tapped it thoughtfully there, his mind off looking for a proper name. ""Groupie."" He blurted out when the answer was clear, a present smile on his face, the blade was back at her wrist. Her mouth dropping open and her teeth grinding at the fate waiting on her, his cut would make her insane. ""Like all those celebrities have Groupies, I will only need you. You will be my Harley. We can have so much fun together."" ""Why?"" ""I""m sure Batman doesn""t go around looking for sidekicks and beautoful broads to throw over his shoulder. This way I will have you, I will have something..."" He leaned downward, elbows on his knees, the knife slowly began to cut. Her breath hitches and she let out a heated moan. ""Violent."" He ground out in a animalistic tone.",6234395

Everyone lined up in their usual positions as their captain checked their attendance. They started with the warm-ups. ""Pair up. We""ll start with the sit-ups."" Levi""s stern voice instantly made the cadets move. As Eren was about to walk towards Armin to pair up, the corporal""s command made him stop in his tracks. ""Ackerman. Do Jaeger."" All of the cadets had their eyes on Levi, just as shocked and confused as Eren and Mikasa. The raven-haired cadet didn""t know what to react; would she get cross with the corporal or will she be grateful? Either way, she could see the hesitation in Eren""s eyes, unable to look at her. Somehow, she felt regret. ""P-pardon, Corporal?"" Eren sputtered, unable to move. Levi walked towards him briskly, as if ready to take aim and punch the daylights out of him. ""Pair up with Ackerman.

51,"Ulrich stroked the base of his submissive""s skull, and William released a low, purring noise from his throat. The final buckle wrapped around to the front, interlocking with a D-ring; all that was missing was the padlock. ""I""ll see you tonight, my sweet William."" Ulrich said, kissing him on the lips. When the padlock clicked into place, William""s consciousness faded. William closed his eyes and let the darkness-and the safety of Ulrich""s presence, overtake him. His body was now under Ulrich""s control. Now, Ulrich has trained and held many submissives over the years, but William was the only one who could suppress his mental functions so completely so as to (what seemed to Ulrich) disable his short-term memory but leave all William""s other functions intact. Ulrich lived on control and while he disapproved of X.A.N.A. forcibly taking control of William""s body, he had to admit, somewhere inside of him Ulrich had been jealous. Because whatever feelings Ulrich held towards William personally, he had sensed William""s submissive side soon after they met. Call it a third sense, but Ulrich lived for control over submissives. Normally he wouldn""t have been able to tell, but lifestyle submissives, those he could spot a mile away. Because they were different from the rest. They lived for people like Ulrich, for Dominants to control their every move, to live and breathe the D/s lifestyle. So damn it all that X.A.N.A. had gotten to William first. Once William was freed from X.A.N.A. ""s control, Ulrich had been done waiting. X.A.N.A. had gotten to William before Ulrich had been able to begin operation ""Control William"". Yeah, it was a stupid title, but it""s not like anyone was going to find out. But now William was free and Ulrich would make damn sure it didn""t stay that way because Ulrich had plans, and his currently goal was making (and keeping) William as his submissive. By any means necessary. Ulrich was a bastard. He called Yumi to ""their spot"" in the forest, because Aelita""s appearance in the real world sparked a fire inside him. Ulrich saw how happy Aelita and Jeremie were to finally be able to touch each other, to know they are now standing in the same room instead of through a virtual screen. Those emotions, the relief and happiness those two felt, had been contagious. Yet, it also reminded Ulrich that he had been stringing along his relationship with Yumi. He liked her, and before William, he had been sure that ""like"" was close enough to ""love"" that Ulrich had confused the two. See, submissives for Ulrich had always been that, not involved in his daily life outside of what use they could provide him. Finding a submissive to become a willingly helpless slave... it was a rare trait, and so far, not one had even come close to the wonders he found within William. Ulrich kept William at a distance during their ""training"" period. Yet had underestimated just how submissive William was. Somewhere along the way, the lines between submissive and William began to converge. Ulrich shook his head, shrugging off the past. Now was no time to reminisce.",583994
130,"It smells pretty delicious."" he said, hoping to calm down Omiko at least a little. His stomach""s grumble accompanied his words. Unfortunately, it only seemed to make her more agitated. A red flush came onto her face as she spoke. ""I-I""m not sharing, so don""t even think about asking!"" For some reason, the very thought of sharing her precious lunch with Takaharu made Omiko heat up with embarrassment. His gap-toothed smile wasn""t helping very much either, and she found herself being overly protective of the box filled with fresh tuna fish caught and prepared by her father straight from Tokyo Bay. Looking for a way to ease the situation, Takaharu""s keen eyes spotted the empty seat on the bench next to him. His stomach growled loudly again, causing Omiko to narrow her eyes as it further fueled her paranoia of him stealing her food. ""Is it alright if I take that seat?"" Takaharu asked quite innocently. There was a few seconds of silence as Omiko thought about it. Finally, she sighed, and turned as she moved slightly to give him space. ""Fine. Just don""t touch my food."" she reminded him, but Takaharu still smiled as he took the seat and allowed himself to relax. A few more seconds of silence passed as Takaharu stared up at the sky. Omiko, now somewhat comfortable again, began eating the next tuna in her bento box, trying to enjoy every wet, briny bite. She made note to be careful in her eating however, not getting a single grease stain on her spotless No-Star ensemble despite how messy her chewing seemed. Finally, Takaharu seemed unable to handle simply sitting next to his classmate and fellow club president like this. ""So."" he said, his tone of voice relaxed. ""How did you first club meeting go yesterday?"" Omiko stopped chewing instantly. She was so unprepared for that question, in fact, that she almost allowed the tail of the tuna she was chewing on to drop onto her dress. Slurping up the tail before it could escape her lips, Omiko processed what she could possibly say to Takaharu without making herself look like a complete novice for being unable to keep even one club member after her first day. ""Great."" she responded, smiling through her teeth sounding quite satisfied. ""It was perfect, in fact."" Takaharu""s eyebrows perked up as he listened to her talk about her success. He sighed to himself, before smiling and looking up again. ""Well, that sounds great, Hakodate-san. I wish I had been so lucky."" Omiko laughed. ""Oh, don""t humor me. We both know you""re just playing modest to save face, when you""re really sitting on a gold mine of members for your Boxing Club."" ""I""m being serious!"" Takaharu insisted. ""I""m not some Mickey Goldmill here! I scared away all of the people who joined my club. I don""t have a body in that room to speak of. Well, not any conscious ones."" Takaharu gulped, as he remembered the No-Star who he had accidentally knocked out. Takaharu could only hope that the boy had woken up and left by now, and that none of his blood had gotten onto the pristine ring floor that Takaharu had worked so hard to keep clean.",967934
1148,"Jamie dodged Brianne and a few other students and picked up his speed. He just had to catch her. ""Please! Tell me what""s wrong!"" Jamie pushed two students out of his way and grabbed Catie by the shirt. ""Let me go! Let me go!"" Jamie wrapped his arms around Catie""s waist and pulled her into a bear hug no matter the struggling she was giving him. ""Catie. What""s wrong?"" Catie fell to the ground sobbing dragging Jamie down with her. ""You lied to me"" Jamie looked down at Catie, with a look of shock on his face. ""What?"" Tyler stopped a few inches away from Catie and Jamie with Val and Hank behind him; all of them had looks of concern on their faces but didn""t dare say a word. ""You lied to me Jamie! You told me there was nothing to be said! That was a lie!"" Jamie let go of Catie and tilted her chin up and looked into her eyes. ""I thought you didn""t remember"" Catie""s shoved him away. She pushed herself up. ""And that makes it better? What you did better? So I couldn""t remember so that gave you the right to lie to me for 2 weeks? I asked you Jamie! I asked you what happened and you said nothing! That it was all over and there was nothing to talk about! No biggie!"" Jamie looked down. ""You lied to me and I had to find out what happened in some sort of flashback. I would have rather heard it from you"" Catie looked at Jamie for a second and took off running. ""Shouldn""t someone-"" ""I will"" Tyler patted Jamie on the back and took off after Catie. ""Catie! Wait!"" Catie turned around and started pounding Tyler on the chest. Tyler put his arms around her trying to stop her pounding. ""He was only trying to protect you. For the past 2 weeks, that""s all he has been trying to do, but I guess it kinda backfired on him. The only reason he didn""t tell you, was because he cared"" Catie stopped pounding and just Tyler hug her. ""What happened? Tell me the truth"" Tyler looked down at her and opened his mouth started to talk. ""So you see he was only trying to protect you"" Tyler finally took in a deep breath of air as he finished his last sentence. Catie stared back at Tyler in utmost shock; she wanted so badly to go to Jamie and say she was sorry but she wouldn""t! She was still angry and she wasn""t going to yield. ""He still lied to me"" Catie zipped up her jacket, finally collecting her cool. Tyler stared back at Catie and noticed that she seemed calmer then she did a few minutes ago. ""But he lied to you to keep you from harm"" Tyler smiled big at Catie. ""A lie is still a lie. Jamie has been my best friend since god knows when and not once have I had to doubt him, doubt him telling me the truth but now I do and I don""t like the feeling"" Tyler looked down at the ground. He was trying to find something to say. He really didn""t want to get in the middle of this but unfortunately that was right where he landed. ""I""m not trying to take sides here or anything but if I had to choose a side, I would definitely be on Jamie""s side.",29783
1263,"His mother before she died had told him stories about love and loss, he had never thought he would feel that. That pain first came with Citra and now with her. He hated himself for it, his mother, but he couldn""t explain why he didn""t hate her. He pulled into the shore near the boats, two to be exact and one of which was reading right beside the one they had taken from his mini isle. Benny was sitting down on its edge staring out into the sunset, his back turned to the jeep. That angered him even more... The thought that another man even bothered with his Luna. He wished right then and there that he had never met her, it would save him from this grief. That he would have to let her go or otherwise face the punishment, her death. BUT WHY DID IT BOTHER HIM?! Vaas grumbled something incoherent to himself as he approached Benny, who at the sound of his footsteps glanced in his direction. ""Where is Luna?"" Vaas placed his hands on his hips and blankly stared out into the sunset. The orange illuminating the masculine features that made up his character. ""She... Um... I let her go."" Vaas mumbled, itching his forehead with a short pause to himself. ""Why did you let her go?"" Benny asked plainly, Vaas shrugged. ""She didn""t seem worth the struggle."" Benny snorted even if Vaas wasn""t joking. ""She is a pain in the ass, isn""t she? I love that about her. She always-"" ""That""s fucking it punto. You""re gonna make me throw the fuck up with that lovey dovey shit. Why are you here?"" Vaas snapped out, not wanting to hear how amazing she was, not wanting to hear anything about her. ""It""s Hoyt. Says he is coming to the island tomorrow for an inspection on the drug fields and some of the villages around here."" Vaas slapped a hand on his forehead and groaned. ""F~Fuck me."" Vaas licked his lips, before his hand dropped. ""I thought he was here just a couple days ago man. He never comes twice a week."" ""Well. He is coming. Thank god Luna is out of the-"" ""Shut the fuck up about that bitch. Nobody gives a fuck."" Vaas gave a fuck... He for some reason gave a lot of fucks about Lunetta, La Luna de Sangre. Benny put his hands up in defense. ""Alright... Sorry."" His eyebrows furrowed a thought came to mind, before quickly being pushed aside. Vaas gestured to the silhouette of the island in the distance, sun sinking behind it. ""We gonna fucking go or what?"" Benny nodded, for some reason he felt that Vaas wasn""t giving the full picture on why Lunetta wasn""t around and it worried him. There was nothing more he could do though, the moon was gone for the month and the sun was dull. The night would be empty for the next week and that scared Benny the most. The dirt stuck to her feet and it was five minutes from five where she stood at the location the man in white named off. She was cautious, she didn""t trust many people and felt that doing this was a huge mistake on her part. Curious overruled that fear however and she felt the need to know more about the things that had been going on lately. About Hoyt, about how this man supposedly knew everything about her.",6234395

""See y"" later doc!"" Irvine hollered. Dr. D just shook his head. ""Sometimes, I wonder with those two..."" continuing his walk along the corridors. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- At least Van looked more presentable. Raven inspected the newly dressed Van, who donned his old clothing back. All the dirt and grime that was in Van when he found him was all gone, and Van was all clean and ready. As Raven put his clothes on, his eyes shifted to Van""s hair. The usual shock of mane had settled on different directions. Van looked pretty much awkward with his hair tied in that kind of hairdo. What was the deal with the band anyway? Grasping the thin material, Raven snapped the band and let his hair fall on his shoulders. Raven gaped at Van, how the shocked tresses of his hair lightly fell in feathery ruffles. He looked very different. ""He looks beautiful...""Raven mused, a smile forming in his lips. But something seems missing... Digging through the pockets of his trouser, he found what he sought for. A small pair of onyx-studded earrings that he brought at a local market two days ago (author""s note: refer to Chapter 6 when Raven returned to find Van hanging on the wall, if you want to know the time span.) Well, that was putting it the merciful way. The dealer ran away after seeing whom he was facing with and took off with his life. Raven just sighed and paid for it, leaving the money as he took the pair. He was thinking of putting it on when he saw Van and forgot all about it. But now that he""s here... ""God...you look...stunning. "" Raven still cannot believe what he was seeing. Van had undergone complete transformation with just a tweaking of his hair and the addition of the earrings. He could have passed off as another person if not for his clan marking on his cheek. Heck, he looked like a rock star in his outfit. Raven stopped gaping enough to dress Van up back to his desert gear, the yellow coat that Van had been wearing over his lieutenant""s uniform. Fitting the goggles back to his eyes, Raven took Van out of the room, where they loaded up on the Geno Breaker to the outskirts of the nearby town. ""Whew...we made it."" Raven said after the long walk across the arid valley, shrouding the Geno Breaker and Shadow inside with a terrain-cloaking device. Van was closely following him, quietly observing the young boy. It was nice that Van was finally responding to Raven""s constant prodding and nudging where to go. Wearing his hood and cloak to keep him from being recognized, Raven took Van""s hand towards the city, where they headed to the nearest inn to rest and have a cup of coffee and mocha java. The inn was bustling with people and it was very crowded until Raven eyed a table at the corner that was empty.",583064

Johnny was surprised to see Mike come by and didn""t expect him to find him in all places; a skate park. Mike climbs onto Johnny""s shoulder, to which the gorilla responded, ""Sorry, Mike.

""Looking forward to it, Johnny boy."" Mike said, putting his shades on before driving off.

1575,"For may days, he stayed in the dark dungeon, managing on his ration of meat and enjoying the constant appearances of enemies spawning in front of him and at his back. The Skeleton Soldiers were an easy way for experience and loot, but the Skeleton Archers were a pain. Their high dexterity kept them hitting Byakko, and the Drainliars were feasting on his blood as well, having high dexterity and hit rating too. Byakko managed to cut of the Drainliars wings for loot and for an easy kill, while he made a beeline for any Skeleton Archer that was attacking him, hitting it first before the Skeleton Soldiers that were trailing on his back. This he did until he reached Base level 57. But everything was tiring him... ""Aaaah...""Byakko shielded his eyes from the blinding sun as he finally stepped out of the pyramids. It was a long time, too long perhaps, that he had come out of the dark dungeon. His backpack was loaded with Skel-Bones and Wings of Red Bat, sadly no SS card or AoA. All he got was a lousy Archer Skeleton Card, and that was just as well pretty useless, whether implemented or not. He decided to return back to Prontera, to see how things went... ""...Byakko! Is that my acolyte!?!?!"" The Flower Lady shrieked in joy and fraternal concern when he saw the exhausted acolyte enter the south gates of Prontera City. ""Hey...ne-chan. Long time no see, I guess...""Byakko gave a faint smile as he neared her. Flower Lady shook off her customers just to attend to him first. ""How are you my boy? How are you feeling? Are you okay?"" Flower Lady began squeezing his cheeks, examining him for any abnormality. Frankly, he was kinda abnormal already... ""I...I""m fine...""Byakko gave a /pif as he rummaged at his almost torn backpack. It was already burdening his back, owing that the Skel-Bones and Wings of Red Bat were piercing through the leather covering. Laying his bag on the ground, which coincidentally busted on its seams, the bones and dried wings littered around Flower Lady. ""My...My...This is so much. Let me get my Kafra-certified calculating compact machine."" Flower Lady took something from her bosom, and slammed it into the stone sidewalk as Byakko realized it was an ancient cash register, which was truthfully gigantic He could have sworn that the cash register would have registered 7.6 in the Tristan III Earthquake Scaling System. ""That""s compact..."" Byakko sweatdropped at the dusty machine that still had cobwebs clinging to it, and he thought NPCs were just good in Math. ""Okay...it sums up to 308k!"" Flower Lady finally finished counting the loots. Leering slowly at the shocked acolyte, she whispered. ""...of course, without the NPC Overcharge yet. He he he..."" There she goes again, cackling like a Bathory. After counting his zennies, Byakko thought of his backpack. Flower Lady pitied him and decided to replace his brown backpack with a stronger ebony one. Flower Lady whispered onto his ear. ""It""s a new accessory I""ve been working on. That bag is made out of Deviruchi hide and can enable you to use [Increase Weight Limit] Level 5.",583064
573,"I could promise to be there in sickness and in health. He loved this woman he""d proposed to, she""d make a fine wife. She""d be the Adele to his Chief, a traditional woman with a hidden strength and dignity. I could say ""till death do us part. Cristina would""ve been his Ellis Grey. But I won""t. He""d loved Cristina, so much that he walked away. He didn""t want to see her break herself into becoming the woman he wanted. They both deserved better than that. Those vows are for optimistic couples. Preston had always placed his bets on long-shots, and part of him always secretly hoped she""d come back to him. The ones full of hope.

He remembered the call distinctly, Derek had just casually mention Yang""s new guy and feelings that weren""t supposed to be there anymore came rushing back. Burke found that he desperately wanted more information but didn""t know how to go about getting it. I am not optimistic, I am not hopeful. ""Is it serious?""

I am sure, I am steady, and I know. ""What""s he like?"" ""Why do you want to know?"" Burke didn""t even want to think the answer to that.

He""s a good man."" Sounded a lot like Cristina. I hold them in my hands. Derek shifted the conversation. ""So, another wedding. That must be exciting. I""m guessing I""m not going to be best man at this one."" Burke could see Derek smiling and felt his own lips tug up. ""You""ve never even met the bride, Derek. With Cristina, marrying her was practically a lifetime commitment to you too because of Meredith."" I am a heart man. That was the moment Derek brought up his own enagement to Meredith. Burke refrained from asking the question if he""d be invited to that one. So this, I am sure. Cristina would be certain to be maid of honor. She""d have to be there to keep Meredith from freaking out, just like she did at their wedding. Would he want to see her? You are my partner, my lover, my very best friend.

They were right to do so, for on the next day, there""s a horrible confusion at the ""Planet"": Perry only talks Spanish, Jimmy can only express himself in Gaelic, and Lois speaks Ancient Egyptian. Clark is not better off, either; he understands everything but cannot talk at all. And to top it all off, Lois and Clark""s child decides to learn to talk exactly in this time. His first words: ""J""ai faim!""... This is beyond any doubt the most chaotic episode of the season, if not of the whole series. Dean Cain hardly talks, since Clark cannot speak during the whole Babylonian confusion. This is perfect for people who are interested in language. The title is a mixture of English, French, German, Swedish and Spanish and means ""So many different foreign languages."" 5.13: Clarks Of A Feather Special guest star: John Shea (Lex Luthor) The wall separating the two worlds that Lois and Clark know is getting thinner and thinner. Both, Clark and the parallel Clark - who has meanwhile found his Lois with help from H. G. Wells - can feel it, for they can suddenly communicate. And Clark gets the shock of his life when he learns that Lex Luthor is still alive in the other world - over there, however, he""s not the billionaire, but a simple newscaster. The two Clarks realize that everyone is in the other world the contrary of what he or she is in his or her own world. Jimmy, for instance, is in one world man Friday and in the other the owner of the ""Daily Planet"". The other Clark lost his parents at the age of ten and has therefore made all the experiences that Clark had been spared. And in the parallel world, people know that Clark is Superman. If the separating wall was to get even thinner, it could have fatal consequences: Either the two worlds become one; in this case, the memories of the persons from both sides would be combined until a sort of good average would be reached. Or everyone will be able to see their reflection and realize the things that could have been. In both cases the world would learn that Clark is Superman - but in the latter case, everyone else would lose their minds... Finally we meet John ""Lex Luthor"" Shea again. Emily Procter (meanwhile known as Calleigh Duquesne from ""CSI: Miami"") as Lana Lang stars, too.

And the result in many cases is death. Lois and Clark are looking for a Poe fanatic who makes the imagination of his idol become reality. Surrounded by pits, pendulums, casks, orang utans and ravens, Lois and Clark follow the footsteps of the great poet, hoping to find a trace leading them to the originator of all of this.",240213

""Is there such a rush?"" I attempted to say as we were running fast along the sidewalk. I could already hear honks and angry curses all around us.

We""ve got to use it up as much as possible!"" Haruhi replied to me, unaware she had knocked over multiple people as she pulled me along. An old man who had been knocked aside yelled various obscenities at us as he raised his cane up in the air. Not so much a good way to start the day.... I knew Haruhi was athletic, but I certainly wasn""t. We""d been running for about thirty minutes before finally reaching our destination. A destination she never really mentioned anything about. Like I said; I had trouble deciding if this whole thing was some sort of date or not. If Haruhi really loved me like Itsuki had said, then for all I know, this whole thing might be what she considered a date. One that I only partially agreed to. But, I""m not one to go arguing with a girl who can manipulate reality if she gets pissed. I sigh. This day might be longer than expected... ""Here we are!"" Suzumiya-san announced to me, and I looked up, almost out of breath.",967934
2486,"Anyone who could care for her Bruce was worth taking note of. Jim Gordon wasn""t one of hers, but she decided James Gordon would be. As Bruce Wayne reached out to take his hand, Gotham cast her spell between the two of them, binding their fates together. James Gordon wasn""t what she wanted in the long run, but he was what had at the moment. She needed time to work through the ideas that were beginning to form within her, but for now she would make due. James Gordon would serve as a proxy to make the changes she was beginning to contemplate. Gotham was a city of fresh starts and hopeless endings, and this wouldn""t be the first time she reinvented herself to suit the times. She would use Detective Gordon until the time was right to create what she really wanted. Outside of her office, Captain Sarah Essen heard the elevated voices that portended yet another fight among Gotham""s finest. She didn""t even need to look up from her paperwork to know that the rookie Gordon would be right in the middle. Digging through her lower right desk drawer, she grabbed the industrial sized bottle of ibuprofen and shook out three tablets. She downed them quickly with the help of the lukewarm, police-made coffee that she drank without tasting. She decided to wait for Bullock to come to her, rather than going out there and cutting things off. The boys needed to learn to work things out amongst themselves. Sarah shoved the signed papers closing the Mario Pepper case into the outbox for her secretary to collect for filing later. It was convenient that Bullock always shot to kill, but she wished Gordon understood why that was a good thing. The noise from the bullpen settled into more manageable levels, and she took a glance outside of her window, confirming that Jim Gordon had taken himself off somewhere. He had been quietly seething ever since he had joined the program. Sarah regretted the way he looked at her now, but it had been inevitable that he learned about what kept the GCPD running. All of Gotham""s homicide cops had the shiny knocked off quickly. Ten minutes later, even the usual hum of the bullpen went still. Sarah kept her eyes on the preliminary duty rosters, even though she knew who was about to enter her office. She waited for the tap on her door before rising to her feet to greet Mayor Aubrey James with an extended hand. ""What can I do for you today?"" she asked for the audience outside of the door as it clicked closed. ""I""m just stopping by to thank you personally for all of the GCPD""s hard work at solving the Wayne murders,"" he announced in his ""I""m a politician"" voice. He extended a hand to her, and she shook it firmly, aware that her glass-sided office was the attention of the entire department. ""Thank you. The GCPD is grateful for your appreciation."" In some cities, getting a personal visit from the mayor would have been a form of a compliment. In places like Metropolis and Star City, the police captain would have been ordered to report to the mayor""s office as a sign that the mayor had them at his beck and call.",1112924
2526,"Finn, standing in front of the urinal, didn""t bother calling a greeting, since he was doing his own private thing and, you know, having his dingdong out make him self-conscious. But he did note the other Gleek""s arrival, knowing he""d have to step in if the other guys decided today was a good day for swirlies. Usually he""d let them do whatever, but he was supposed to work on a duet with Kurt, and having to spend the afternoon as the main focus of Kurt""s sarcasm would totally suck. Finn finished zipping up his jeans and went to the sink next to Kurt in an attempt to make sure no one could get at the male diva easily. There were all kinds of swine flu warning signs, which actually concerned him enough that he was going to wash his hands. Most of the time he didn""t bother, but the last thing he wanted was to get sick. He""d heard that it wasn""t good for pregnant women, and heaven knew he""d already done enough to piss Quinn off in the last twenty four hours (though Finn still wasn""t sure what was wrong with wanting to have sex since it wasn""t like he could make her pregnant again... unless that was how twins were made). Tyson, the baseball team""s star right fielder, noticed the intrusion and jerked his head at the well-dressed teen who was currently applying makeup. Unfortunately Karofsky, who has recently become the bane of Finn""s existence, was nearby, and ready to take the opening. He stalked forward, coming to stand beside Finn, but luckily out of arm""s reach of Kurt. ""Move it, fag,"" Karofsky said belligerently, coming up to the sink. ""This isn""t a strip club for you to get your jollies from."" Kurt merely cocked an eyebrow, seemingly oblivious to the precarious nature of his situation. ""First, I""m not gay. Second, even if I was, there""s no way I""d want to look at your tiny dick."" ""Sure you""re not gay,"" Karofsky said with a derisive snort. ""Haven""t you ever heard the term ""metrosexual?'"" Kurt replied as he continued to exam his reflection in the mirror, digging out a comb so he could work on his already over-maintained hair. Karofsky snorted. ""Sure. It means ""closeted queer.'"" Kurt rolled his eyes. ""Keep believing that, idiot. Girls like guys who are in touch with our feelings,"" he said, before letting a smug look cross his face. ""Being ""in touch"" has gotten me plenty to touch."" By now, the entire restroom had gone silent, with only the sound of the running water making any noise. Seconds later, Puck, the school""s resident ladies man, came out of a stall with a dangerous expression on his face. Finn felt himself tense, knowing that things were going to get really bad unless Kurt was wise enough to make a clean break. ""Just because Mercedes lets you grope her doesn""t mean you know what the hell to do with a woman, choirboy,"" Puck said, propping himself against the wall. ""Don""t underestimate how powerful chocolate love is,"" Kurt replied. ""I""d tell you to try her sometime, but she""s far too good for you."" Puck growled and slammed his fist into a hand threateningly. ""Do you need to get reacquainted with the dumpster, fag?"" Kurt sniffed, undaunted.",1112924
1038,"""I was just passing though the city center when someone had pointed out who I was. I was so startled that my hood fell down. I looked around to see who it was, when... No. He""s dead now. I... I can""t remember exactly what happened after that, but the next thing that I remember is being thrown in a cell in one of the lower dungeons inside Alexandria castle."" Kuja ran up to Zidane, lightly touching his shoulders. ""Please, you have to hurry and find me, I... I don""t know how much time I have left. Beatrix has been taken over by Queen Brahm""s ghost, or spirit, her will is no longer her own. The things she did... You have to hurry, Zidane! You have to go back to our world and bring me back from Avalon."" Zidane stepped back from Kuja, slightly frantic. ""What... what are you talking about? Just come back with me and Eiko! Everything will be fine then, you""ll see! Come on!"" Zidane reached for Kuja""s arm, but his hand had passed right though. Kuja looked at Zidane sadly. ""Zidane, the only reason I came to Avalon was to prolong my life so that... maybe, even if just by chance, I might be able to see you again. Coming to the Mists of Avalon took most of my power, but it was the only way I could think of to stay alive without any medical support. Zidane, if I stay here any longer, I won""t be able to go back."" Zidane looked at Kuja. Kuja was asking for his help, and Zidane knew that he would never be able to deny him that. ""If I saved you once, then I can do it again. Kuja, I will do anything under my power to help you! I love you, Kuja, I""ll always love you. Just tell me what I have to do."" ""Well, if you bring me a doctor, lots of food, maybe a better place to stay... Ah, okay, okay. All I really need is to see you again, Zidane. You, and a doctor."" Zidane laughed. ""Okay, I get your point. Just tell me how I can find you, and we""ll be together forever after that."" ""Easy."" Kuja let out a whistle, and a small yellow canary flew swooped into view. Zidane watched as it flew around them. He reached out his hand as a perch for the bird, but the small canary just flew right though his hand. The little bird circled around them before coming to a rest upon Kuja""s hand. ""His name is Jojo. When you get back, just call his name, and he""ll come to you. When you""re ready, just say ""ikuzo"" and little Jojo here will lead you to me. But be careful,"" Kuja smiled. ""He flies fast."" With a couple happy chirps, Jojo took off into the air, circling the area a couple more times before flying off into the forest. Zidane turned back to Kuja. ""I don""t think we have much time left. I have to go back to our world soon, I can feel it. Eiko""s power is..."" ""Then go, Zidane. I""ll still be waiting for you when you get back."" Kuja smiled. ""I promise."" ""Kuja, kiss me."" Kuja stared at Zidane. ""Zidane, I""m not really here. You won""t be able to -"" ""I""m not leaving until you kiss me."" Kuja gazed into bright sapphire-blue eyes. ""Zidane, if I promise to let you pay me back double when we meet again, will you leave this place with Eiko?""",583994
1049,"The hard rain turned into drizzle then back to being hard. She shivered involuntarily. It was definitely cold. ""You""ll shiver to death if you stay there any longer."" She blinked. That voice... ""Athrun...?"" He was standing there, an umbrella on his hand. Judging by his outfit, he just came out from the church. A gentle smile grazed his face. Cagalli was rendered speechless. Of all the people who could find her, why did it have to be him? But then, he was definitely better than Yuna and his cronies. He took small steps forward until he was a foot away from her. He bent down and patted her head, just like what a brother would do to his little sister. ""You had us all worried, Cagalli,"" he remarked gently. Cagalli pushed him roughly. ""What are you doing here!"" she demanded. It was obvious that some part of her was happy of his presence. But then, right now wasn""t the time to admit it. She didn""t need him- she vowed to herself that she didn""t need him. And Cagalli doesn""t like breaking her oath. She knew she couldn""t deny anything from him. Even if he lacked his memories, Athrun is still Athrun. His eyes could see right through her lies, her cascade, and her poker face. ""I""m here to bring you back-"" ""I""M NOT GOING BACK!"" Cagalli shouted, as she pulled herself to her feet. She couldn""t believe it! Athrun was taking her back to that hell! Did she escape that place just to be brought back by the person who caused her to run away from it in the first place! ""-where you really belong,"" Athrun finished. Cagalli stopped in her tracks and looked at him quizzically. ""What was that?"" That remark really caught Cagalli""s attention. Was Athrun playing some trick? What is he planning? What did he mean? Athrun smiled and handed his umbrella to the lady. ""You""ll shiver to death if you stay here any longer."" ""Hey! you didn""t answer me!"" Cagalli was still Cagalli and she had the quickest temper on Earth... or even at the PLANTs. ""You don""t need to go back,"" Athrun explained as he tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. ""Where do you really want to go, Cagalli?"" It was faint, but definitely it was a blush. It had been a while since Cagalli blushed and, as much as she hated it, her feelings for a certain blue-haired coordinator were creeping back to her. She didn""t know what to make out of his simple words... his gestures, they were gentle. There was no pressure in his words. He was letting her decide. It scared her. She knew that about half an hour ago, she made a decision that definitely placed Orb in an unstable situation. She didn""t want to repeat the same mistake. There was a little voice in her head that wanted her to be free. But her rational mind wouldn""t allow it. She knew that what she""ll do is running away. And right now, running wasn""t an option. ""Anywhere, Cagalli, I""ll accompany you,"" Athrun suddenly added. Cagalli could feel water dropping down her cheeks but she wasn""t the type to admit they were tears. It didn""t matter anyway, for the bliss she felt was numbing. It was Athrun""s reassuring smile.",560480
1978,"He looked to his guide, who still in her female form had snuck into the room with him. She nodded. ""Yeah, they""re ready."" Tygra studied the map again, nodding, ""We have a chance, Lion-O. But this could work."" He stood up completely, and began to rub his neck. ""How are we on supplies?"" Lion-O wasn""t used to seeing Tygra like this. It""d been minutes since he""d made a snide comment or a joke. It unnerved him, almost more than being treated as an equal. He turned to the guide again, who nodded again. ""We""re ready to go, your majesty."" Tygra""s lip curled, ""Don""t call me that."" He spoke again, but quietly this time, ""I hate this, Lion-O. I hate every minute of it."" ""Being king?"" Lion-O questioned, but Tygra didn""t reply, it almost seemed like he""d dozed off since his eyes were closed and he wasn""t moving. Lion-O looked at the Sword on his brother""s arm. He barely whispered, ""I would want to be king."" Amazingly, Tygra had heard him. ""You would want this?"" He questioned. Lion-O thought about it. The responsibility, the sacrifice... But he answered the only way he found he could, ""Yes."" ""I""ll remember that, brother."" Suddenly, someone burst through the door. He bowed to the King and the Prince. ""Your Majesties, Mumm-Ra approaches."" On the wall was not a great place to be before a battle. All that hung in the air was the nervous tension of the upcoming battle. The enemy could barely be seen, but it was still enough to cause the warriors to tremble. Lion-O hated that he was impressed by his brother""s strategy. Many of the animals had united together under the ThunderCat banner, and he kept every group just separate enough to sure there would be no chance of switching of sides. The king had even sprinkled clerics throughout the ranks. ""You look nervous, Prince Lion-O."" She was wearing her cleric""s mask, but Lion-O recognized the voice, ""Cheetara."" He wanted to think she smiled, but couldn""t know for sure. She hopped onto the edge of the wall with perfect grace and looked out towards the approaching enemy, who could now be heard. ""I hope you made your peace with Tygra before the battle. It would be a shame if one of you perished without the other""s forgiveness."" They""d been fighting? Tygra hadn""t given that impression, but Lion-O guessed that being on the verge of war made whatever their fight was about seem insignificant. He looked to his guide, who was sitting to the left of Cheetara. She sighed before answering his unspoken question, ""As his heir, you were the only choice for the second command, but Tygra was worried that you were too young so he assigned an older General to lead with you."" Lion-O could see why that would upset him - he hated when his brother treated him like a cub. Though more removed in this situation, Lion-O could see it was just Tygra""s way of caring. He shook his head and answered Cheetara, ""We wished each other luck in the battle, though you know Tygra, he couldn""t resist a jab before riding off."" Cheetara""s eyes softened, ""Yes, I know Ty well."" It was the first time Lion-O had ever heard someone call Tygra that name.",1497577
3733,"she floated backwards, wanting to give them both their privacy but she accidentally bumped on one of the boxes behind her that caused a pretty loud noise that startled Princess Bubblegum and Marshall Lee. ""Marceline?"" the princess called out. The young vampire king turned around and gave Marceline a disappointed glare. This made her grin. ""Am I interrupting something?"" she said slyly. The other princess blushed furiously, and waved her hands frantically. ""N-no you weren""t."" She simply replied. Princess Bubblegum gave a quick glance at Marshall Lee and then walked out of the attic hastily. ""I should probably clear the misunderstanding by now."" She said as she stopped walking by the doorway. ""You are our guest, Marshall Lee."" She added with a small smile and continued walking. Marceline and Marshall Lee nodded in agreement as they floated outside as well. Back at the lobby of the castle, Princess Bubblegum stood in the middle and gathered all the candy people. There, she cleared the confusion Ooo""s hero accidentally did and advised the people to treat Marshall Lee as a ""guest"". ""This may sound a bit ridiculous but with this vampire""s sudden appearance, it gave us a sign that there is another dimension. It""s a scientific break-through and it can benefit us."" Princess Bubblegum said, wherein the candy people sublimely agreed into. The princess smiled and then nodded as she dismissed everyone in the lobby. Everyone walked out, whispering and talking about how caring and amazing their beloved ruler is. Finn and Jake went to the princess""s side. Finn scratched the back of his head shyly. ""Gee, Peebs. I""m really sorry with all the trouble I caused today. I didn""t mean to attack your guest. I just wanted to protect you."" He said, in which Jake hurriedly sided with Finn""s apology. The princess smiled warmly and then patted the young hero""s head. ""I know, and you did a great job."" She said. Just at the moment, the two vampires appeared. Marshall Lee floated towards Princess Bubblegum as he scratched the back of his head. ""I owe you a lot, princess. Thanks for... you know..."" he paused, as he struggled to find the right words to say. Princess Bubblegum simply smiled, and then placed a hand on his shoulder. ""You""re welcome."" She said. Marshall Lee smiled in return, unable to say anything. Jake and Marceline stared at the two for a moment and then looked at each other, as if talking in telepathy. ""Weird, are they getting along?' ""Don""t ask me, I am just his alternate.' ""Finn, I am hosting an afternoon tea party at my garden tomorrow. You think you can come?"" Princess Bubblegum asked, breaking the silence within them. ""What""s the party for?"" Marceline asked instantly. ""It""s more of a welcome party for your alternate."" The princess replied. ""Cool, a party just for me!"" Marshall Lee said with a sheepish grin. Finn rubbed the back of his neck with his gaze averted as he replied. ""Thanks for the invite, princess. But... I kinda made a promise with Flame Princess tomorrow afternoon. You know... a date.""",2750536
1964,"Andy tried not to keep eye contact, but she knew she wouldn""t be able to do it for long. Xavier was like her grandfather. She couldn""t completely ignore him. ""Just like old times huh,"" Magneto said as he walked toward the gate where the other brotherhood members were waiting. ""She needs help Erik. Jean is not well,"" Xavier said grasping Andy""s hand for a short second just to squeeze it to reassure her it would be alright. Andy tensed, but then relaxed. It was like a complete cure over her nervousness. She knew he had messed with something in her mind, but what, she didn""t know. ""Funny you sound just like her parents,"" Magneto said with a strain in his voice as he walked the hill like path. Magneto stopped when he was close to Juggernaut. Andy couldn""t hear him, but she had learned to read lips while she was in the brotherhood and she knew damn well what he had just said. ""Nobody gets in the house."" Andy felt a fear wash over her and Xavier noticed this and began to try and calm her once more. As Magneto quickly walked up the path to catch up to them Andy unlocked the door with a twist of her hand and her powers. The door opened without a hand to touch it and Xavier rolled inside. ""I see your powers have improved as well child,"" Xavier said with a light smile. ""It helps when you have a teacher,"" Andy said a little to coldly than she meant to. ""I""m sorry. I just thought you needed to learn them.... I thought you needed to protect yourself,"" Xavier said as all three mutants hairs stood on end. One was from the chill going up their spines, and two the tension in the air due to Jean""s powers. As the three walked into the kitchen they found that the closer they got the more the room seemed to hover. In fact Andy felt herself almost lift off the ground, but she set her powers to where they""d keep her in place. As they got closer to room Jean was in, she couldn""t help but feel a nauseated feeling pull at her stomach. She was afraid of Jean, or at least this Jean. When the three mutants walked into Jean""s living room, Andy could have sworn she almost threw up in her mouth. She was afraid and her nerves were getting at her. Watching her mother sit in a chair, tightly grasping it as if it was her lifeline, did not help the situation of the room hovering. The moment they were noticed though everything fell and at least then Andy felt a little better as some tension went away. Jean looked at the two men first with cold eyes before switching to Andy""s direction and then Andy could have sworn they softened for a moment before they turned evil again. ""I knew you""d come,"" Jean said softly looking at Xavier. ""Of course. I""ve come to bring you home,"" Xavier said and that""s all it took to send an angry look building onto Jean""s face. ""I have no home,"" Jean said through gritted teeth. ""Yes you do mom,"" Andy said inching closer to her than the other two were. ""You have a home and a family Jean,"" Xavier said pointing at Andy. Jean seemed to be slowly falling for it until Magneto spoke up.",806976
1690,"Accept that fact and everything""s okay again."" Princess Bubblegum blushed, feeling his hot breath on her face. She was too close, she thought. It was also at this moment that she realized that the young vampire was quite handsome. Marshall Lee stared at her eyes a bit more and found fright on it. He pushed her away hurriedly and turned around to cover the blush on his face. ""Damn it, princess."" He muttered. ""What did I do this time, huh?"" ""Oh, you did nothing at all."" He said, a bit of sarcasm obvious in his voice. ""You did absolutely nothing and made me blush this way. Damn it, blush won""t go away.' Princess Bubblegum smiled a bit when she saw a faint blush on the side of his cheek. ""Okay, Marshall Lee."" She said. ""Marceline, I found nothing on my side. How about you?"" Finn said. ""No luck."" She said. Then, she turned to Jake, the last person to return. ""Nothing, guys."" He said. All three gave each other a glance then nodded. ""To the Southern side we go!"" Jake said, a bit excited. ""RADICAL!"" Finn said as he raised his sword. Marceline sighed, and then smiled. ""Boys."" She mumbled. Aaaaaaand that ends chapter 3. The next chappie might be a little later :) I have a 3-day retreat in my school... and I am busy... so yah. See ya""ll! Sorry for the veeeeeeeery late update guys D: I had this very annoying author""s block plus, I""ve still got three hanging fanfics to continue and people are begging me to update. So if it""s a bit rushed, please forgive me. I did my best. Finn, Jake and Marceline reached the Southern side and they started searching for Princess Bubblegum and Marshall Lee. Finn decided to look inside the rooms, Jake searched in the lobby while Marceline went for the attic. As they agreed on, when no one finds nothing or finds something, they would all come back to their meeting place in the South. Marceline floated up to the attic and pulled out a few cobwebs. She noticed that some boxes were moved, as if someone had just been there. She smirked, and then went inside further. She heard some voices just around the corner and floated slowly to that side of the attic. The Vampire Queen was about to surprise attack whoever voice that was, but stopped herself abruptly upon realizing that it was the two people there were looking for. Marshall Lee""s back was facing Marceline, but she could still see a faint smudge of pink on his ear while Princess Bubblegum""s face is clearly seen from Marceline""s perspective. Much to her surprise, the young princess is smiling oddly. A real, genuine smile was sported on the princess""s gentle face. ""She made Bonnie smile."" She said to herself in disbelief. ""He has skills!"" she floated backwards, wanting to give them both their privacy but she accidentally bumped on one of the boxes behind her that caused a pretty loud noise that startled Princess Bubblegum and Marshall Lee. ""Marceline?"" the princess called out. The young vampire king turned around and gave Marceline a disappointed glare. This made her grin. ""Am I interrupting something?"" she said slyly.",2750536
3024,"Berken slowly picked himself up off the floor, frowning. What the hell, Ender mentally calculated the entire scene again. He should have knocked Berken out cold. No teen could have resisted the concussion that force would have caused. ""Ender get out of there, now! You""ve been compromised!"" Homebase crowed in his ear. At the same time, Thatch Goldman recognized him. ""That""s the spook from the Arcade!"" ""Fuck, is he everywhere?!"" groused Derick Leslie. Ender sneered. ""I""m your worst nightmare come to life."" ""Wrong,"" Brace growled, stepping forward, pulling a patch from his pockets and slapping it onto his neck. ""We""re your worst nightmare."" The teen rushed at Ender and he dodged. The wall behind Ender however was damaged beyond repair. The kid plowed through the plaster and some of the beams like they were ribbon and streamers. Definitely not normal. Ender frowned as Brace can at him again, noting how his crew stayed back. So they were just going to leave their leader to his fate, huh, Ender thought. From his peripheral, he watched as Irma slunk out to the balcony, not even wincing as her skin slid against broken glass. She was that desperate to get away from the scene. Ender stood in front of her. ""Ender, I will NOT let you COMPROMISE this mission! Pull OUT. NOW!"" Homebase shrieked in his ear. He turned it off. Damn, the woman was a banshee. Despite what Homebase thought, this wouldn""t compromise the mission. This was him saving a misguided woman from being irreparably scarred by a bunch of underdeveloped and entitled thugs. He just needed Irma to get out of harm""s way and then he would bail too. He had enough footage evidence on his body-cam to prove the Brace Crew""s involvement with the target areas in which the drugs were being distributed. The only loose end to tie up would be where the runts would be sent- Arkham Juvenile Detention or The Quinzel Institute for Teens. Brace came at him again, throwing sloppy punches and cheap blows that Ender danced around. He noted the unease on some faces of the Brace Crew observers. Junior was still knocked out cold. Ender finally hit him when Irma""s shriek distracted him. He grunted, amazed and slightly stunned at the strength behind the lame jab, and saw Irma dangling from the iron bar of her balcony. The blood on her feet probably made her slip from her attempted leap from the bar to the fire escape. Brace kept coming at him, giving Ender no time to help her. He hoped she could hold on, because it seemed like his opponent wasn""t just a drug dealer, but a druggie himself. The kid was taking Juggernaut. AK: What is Juggernaut? Why does Ender care? Where is Max? All these questions answered...soon. Max frowned at the reports she was getting across her tablet. ""This isn""t right..."" She tapped a few commands into the screen and watched as the virtual reactions and mixtures took place. Something was wrong with the formula The Labs created. ""Dr. Pinto, Dr. Giamori,"" she called, addressing the senior scientists on the project. ""Yes, Dr. Gibson.""",3439302

""A convenient mistake,"" Kimblee pointed out. ""The boy practically incriminated himself, who could ask for a better patsy? Not to mention that it heightens the vengeance you wanted."" ""You were supposed to sweep the case quietly under the rug, Kimblee,"" the woman said. ""Is this what you call quiet?"" Her voice never lost its even tone as she pointed to the newspaper on the table in front of them. Kimblee""s eyes flashed. ""I don""t answer to you, Lust or your Father!"" The man paused and took a breath, seeming to get himself back under control. ""Besides, I""m handling it."" ""Now, now, let""s behave,"" a voice said from the head of the table.

""Not at all,"" The tips of Bradley""s mustache twitched upwards and the laugh lines around his eyes became more prominent as he smiled. ""We simply need to make sure that young Mr. Elric is convicted."" ""Shouldn""t be a problem,"" Kimblee responded arrogantly. ""Don""t be so sure,"" Bradley said, eyes opening menacingly. ""I hear Judge Grumman has a soft spot for Mustang."" Kimblee shrugged again. ""Doesn""t matter. The old bastard isn""t about to let personal feelings influence his judgements, he""s too shrewd for that. Besides, everyone knows he""s hard on crime."" ""I wouldn""t be too sure,"" Lust said, then sighed. ""But I have taken matters into my own hands. You should have an easier time at the arraignment on Tuesday."" ""What have you done?"" Bradley asked, eyes narrowed. Lust waved a gloved hand flippantly. ""Nothing much. Just reconnected with an old friend who happens to find himself in the same place as Elric."" Bradley""s eyes lit with understanding. ""And how is Greed?"" ""As charming as ever."" Lust shrugged. ""But easy enough to get along with if you have what he wants."" ""And what might that be?""

She just about talked my ear off at Lyanna""s feast."" Bash assumed the fighting stance, his sword held at the ready. ""Come on, let""s start. I haven""t practiced in ages."" But Francis stood there, smiling at his brother. ""It was Lyanna, wasn""t it?"" Bash lowered his sword. ""How did you-?"" ""I know you better than you think, brother."" Francis mirrored his brother""s stance, and they circled each other. ""You""ve a terrible memory for names, save for pretty girls."" ""Well, she certainly is an intriguing woman,"" Bash said stubbornly. ""Sebastian, I can only warn you to be careful. She""s English, she""s an enemy. What if she""s spying for their king?"" ""Enemy or not, I can assure you I feel nothing for her."" ""Are you certain?"" ""Quite."" Francis then jumped in and started, the room filling with the dull clunks of their wooden swords. Francis needn""t have anything to worry about. Bash usually kept his promises, and this one would be no exception. But Francis knew his brother. It would entirely be a matter of self-control for him, because Bash was easily swayed by a pretty face. And everyone knew Bash had little self-control. Lyanna She""d counted two hundred and six leaves before her eyelids began to feel heavy. Cool wind blew over her face as she lay there underneath a large oak tree in the forest on the castle grounds. She""d taken to retreating here when things at the court got too hectic, as they were today. Yet another addition was made to the court with the arrival of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her ladies-in-waiting. Lyanna had watched her walk up the sand path with Francis and had immediately felt uneasy. So this was the Queen that the English so hated. Many a time her father would come home, grumbling about this and that, and she often heard the words ""that damned Mary"" on his tongue. Almost from birth Lyanna had been taught that the Scots were a savage lot, rampaging farmlands at whatever chance they could get. That was why, he""d said, the king had been so keen on taking her land, and bringing them under control. But the woman who had so confidently approached the royal family looked nothing like a savage. She looked well-bred and well-mannered, with a kind face. She looked, well, queen-like. She was nothing like Queen Catherine, who was as cold as the Channel on a winter day. Lyanna had sat in enough embroidery sessions to learn of Mary and Francis"" betrothal, and Francis seemed happy with Mary at his side as they walked up to the royal family. Lyanna felt guilty for thinking Mary""s kind as savages when the French thought her own people uncivilized.",2855986
330,"Dozens of messages waited me, and a couple... Emails? I froze, remembering how I""d wanted to ask about those yesterday, bit never got the chance. Thankfully Jaehee had left a long note on how to reply. I booted up my computer and, feeling a bit sheepish at ignoring the messenger to wallow in my self pity, set right to work. It wasn""t too hard. I had access to Rika""s old emails and files as well, and they helped me craft email responses to potential party goers. Some noogle searching told me more about the different groups or individuals so I could gear my responses towards getting a ""yes"" from them. I did the work from my desktop after a quick message to Luciel to make sure it was okay. I didn""t want to work in the apartment of a dead woman, especially since V so obviously didn""t like me touching her things to begin with. I checked the app near midnight, when the emails had slowed to a halt. I""d mostly messaged older groups, those who""d already been to RFA parties in the past. Seemed like the best place to start. Zen was in the chat room, along with Jaehee. I swallowed a bubble of jealousy, remembering that lovely voice of his from the video. With a long, deep breath, I let those feelings go. I couldn""t dwell on them. It would bring me back to that place. [Aya]: Hello, Hyun. Jaehee. [ZEN]: Ah, the newcomer arrives! I was beginning to think you""d forgotten about me! I sighed. This man was really going to prove to be too much for me. [Aya]: Sorry. I did not sleep well last night, so ended up sleeping all day instead. [Jaehee Kang]: Did you get my message? [Aya]: Yes, thank you. Just finished sending off a large batch of emails to the list of regulars that I found in Rika""s files, the ones Luciel let me access. [Jaehee Kang]: ... all of them? Very diligent of you. [Aya]: Thank you. I have some experience with coordinating group activities. I helped run student government at my previous university. [ZEN]: Ahh, right. The beautiful foreign exchange student~ [Aya]: Again, Hyun... you don""t even know what I look like. I am using the default profile picture. [ZEN]: Imagination, jagiya *heart emoji* [Aya]: *sighing emoji* [Jaehee Kang]: Excuse me, I have some emails of my own that need answering. [Aya]: Goodnight, Jaehee. [Jaehee Kang]: Goodnight. - Jaehee Kang has left the chatroom - Feeling a little uncomfortable being alone with Zen in the chatroom, I stood up. Leaving my phone on the coffee table, I went to take my coin skirt and shirt from the closet. At least I could get some practice in before going back to bed. Sure, I""d only been awake a few hours... but sleeping a lot was what I did. Or, more accurately, laying in bed unable to sleep but equally unable to find the energy to get up. With those dark thoughts, I returned and set up my computer to play music. A nice, traditional Korean tune I""d found on YouTube. I was in the country, so I might as well practice dancing to it""s music. But before I could start, my phone caught my eyes. A few messages from Zen, in the chatroom I""d left on. [ZEN]: I don""t know if you saw, but I got a new role~!",748687
737,"THE NEXT DAY~ Today is the departure of Arthur from the Philippines. Alfred still is confused. So for the last time, he asked for one last consultation in which Arthur agreed to. ""Okay, git. Now is my last day here so I""ll help you."" The Brit said. ""Gee, Arthur. Thanks."" Later, they went to the living room when Clara went to the market. Arthur whispered something to him too. For a moment, Alfred thought for a while then, grinned. ""Dude, you""re awesome!"" He exclaimed while patting the Brit""s back. ""Of course. Aren""t I the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland?"" He said with a proud smile plastered on his face. Alfred simply rolled his eyes. ""Whatever, geezer."" ""What was that?"" ""Nothing!"" ON THE DEPARTURE~ ""Well Alfred, Clara, I bid you my farewell. Take care you two."" Arthur smiled at the two nations. ""Sure thing, dude. Have a safe trip."" ""Good bye, kuya."" Arthur nodded and smiled at her. ""Oh! And, give my best regards to Seychelles!"" She added. Then, Arthur turned to the American and began to say something.""Alfred! Don""t forget your task, alright?"" Alfred looked up to him and nodded with a big grin. ""Of course!"" He happily replied. AFTER THE DEPARTURE~ The two nations watched as the plane flew peacefully in the skies, holding each others"" hands. Then, they left the port and went back to Clara""s house. Later, they reached her house. ""Um, Clara? Can I have a heart to heart talk with you?"" Alfred said. ""Heart to heart? So gay!' He thought. Clara looked at him for a while. ""Sure thing! Let""s do it in my room."" She suggested as she went up, Alfred hurriedly followed her. ""So, what""s to talk about, kuya?"" She asked innocently. ""Um... something really important!"" Clara simply nodded and opened the door of her room. She hurriedly sat on her bed, inviting the American to sit beside her. ""So what is it?"" She asked again. Alfred was actually nervous for once. ""W-well, i-it""s my birthday next week, so I-I um...yeah... it""s my independence day..."" Instead of being sad like Arthur predicted, she gave him a normal expression. Then suddenly, ""Independence, huh."" She absent-mindedly said with a hint of sadness in her voice. ""Cl-Claire?"" ""What is it?"" She asked again as if nothing happened. ""... Marriage."" Alfred suddenly said, Noticing that he said that out loud, he covered his mouth, ""I sounded like that crazy chick Natalia! ', he thought. Clara cocked an eyebrow, signalling him that she does not understand it. ""I... want to ask you to... b-become one with me?"" ""Now, I sound like that effing commie!' Clara looked at him with a shocked expression. ""W-what?"" ""M-marry! Marry me! Yes that""s it!"" His face went redder than usual when his mouth suddenly said something that wasn""t supposed to come out yet. Clara""s eyes widened with shock and nervousness. Clara froze, therefore. ""Damn that Limey! He told me to ask her for marriage! Definitely a bad idea! Damn, he wanted me to be in trouble.' Alfred sighed in defeat and in shame. ""Claire, I am sorry to ask you that damn question... I must admit, it wasn""t- Clara?""",2750536
1275,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ""We""re back..."" Irvine and Thomas greeted the Guardian Force members that assembled themselves in the debriefing room. ""Glad you""re here...Take a seat, gentlemen..."" Karl motioned for the two to take the vacant seats reserved for them. ""Hey, Thomas,"" Fiona called out to the blonde boy. Thomas looked back at Fiona. ""Where""s Zeke? Is he okay now?"" ""Oh, he""s fine now. He went out desert to regroup himself, I think...He""ll be back as soon as he""s finished, Fiona."" Thomas replied, turning his back as he took his seat alongside Irvine. ""Thanks Thomas!"" Fiona said, taking her seat back to the control panels. She sat back, tinkering over some buttons, making calculations for new data. Moonbay was startled. ""Well, that""s new. Thomas didn""t blush when Fiona called him, he didn""t reply with his smug ""Ms. Fiona!"" he certainly didn""t stutter upon seeing Fiona..."" Moonbay glanced at Irvine. A small smile playing on his face. And he was talking to Thomas, who was also smiling back. Their eyes were just as eager as... Lovers? Moonbay hid her suspicions. ""He he, this might be big news. But just to make sure..."" she thought off, trailing from the room going to the hangar. She was forming plans already. ""Let""s start the meeting. I assume most of you wouldn""t know why I called for this meeting. I have good news and one bad news. Where should I start?"" Karl asked the people in front of him. ""Best if we start with the good one...""Irvine broke the silence. ""Ok then,"" Karl said, shuffling through some pieces of paper on hand. ""First news is, that I have lowered the sentence on Van. He is to be regarded as priority victim instead of a maverick. I had to explain that he experienced a mental illness on his period with Raven."" Karl said smiling. The others heaved a sigh of relief at the news. ""Second is, I have evident data that Van is heading straight back to our base. I just don""t know when, but scouts have reported that Van is proceeding a straight path and we will not miss him when he comes through here."" ""Great news, sir. But what about the bad one?"" Thomas asked. Karl continued. ""...He""s with Raven. That""s the bad news."" Everyone fell silent. It would have been just fine if Van came alone, it would have been easier to capture him and submit him to treatment...but with Raven, who knew that letting go of a valuable asset is a big mistake, life would be a big pain if they tried wrenching Van out from his grasp. ""Any of you have ideas on how we capture both people now?"" Karl gazed at them, their faces as if in a far away place, lost in thought on what to do. ""It""s okay. I guess Van won""t be arriving anytime tonight anyway. Let""s all rest for a while. Irvine, Thomas, stay here for a while. The rest of you may leave..."" Karl said, proceeding to the bridge to look out to the desert. The others left, leaving the three to their lonesome. ""Thomas...can you tell me again what is Van and Raven""s relationship, based on what you saw two days ago?""",583064
194,"Pain shot through her chest. ""Marrying me?"" ""No,"" he answered calmly. She imagined him looking at her intently. ""I regret trying to kill you."" ""Because you failed to?"" she said almost bitterly. ""Sakura."" He said her name with such gentleness and familiarity that caused her heart to ache. ""I.."" There was the barest hint of uncertainty in his voice. ""I was different before. And I am not proud of the things I have done. But believe me when I say that I never wanted to hurt you."" Somehow, she just knew he was being honest. With a sigh, she tried to lighten the mood. ""How did you propose?"" It almost scared her that she somehow knew how he reacted even if she couldn""t see him-his eyebrows must have been raised, surprised by the question. ""Pardon..?"" She snorted. ""I mean, how did you ask me to marry you?"" He must have contemplated for a few moments before answering, ""I gave you a tomato."" Slapping a hand against her forehead, she groaned. ""So I really love tomatoes?"" ""You tolerate them."" She could almost hear the amusement in his voice. ""I""m the one who loves them."" ""Makes sense,"" she muttered. So that must be the reason why she was so attached to the plump red fruit. ""How was our wedding?"" Wasn""t Uchiha Sasuke considered a hero? Surely, their wedding must have been a grand event. ""Simple and quiet,"" he replied. ""We were wed by the Hokage, with our Jounin-sensei and your mentor as witnesses."" She stared at the door incredulously. ""That""s...it?"" ""You were even late,"" he added. Her jaw dropped. ""You must be joking!"" She only heard his deep chuckle as a reply. ""Children?"" she further pressed. ""Do we have any..children?"" ""You""re currently three-almost four-months pregnant."" Her hand clutched her abdomen. So that was why she seemed to be gaining weight. Surprisingly, she didn""t freak out as much as she had thought she would. It was discerning how she somehow knew these things. She sighed. ""What happened to me? Why did I leave Konoha?"" ""You wanted to see me, I suppose,"" he answered, voice slightly strained. ""Because I went to Sunagakure even if you didn""t want me to."" She banged her fist on the door. ""You left me?!"" ""For a mission,"" he confessed. ""But Sakura, you know how much I didn""t want to go."" She could hear the frustration in his voice, and she could also imagine him running his fingers through his black hair. ""This might not have happened if I hadn""t gone-I shouldn""t have left."" She was overcome by a great desire to comfort him. ""Hey.."" she called softly, her palm pressed against the door. ""It""s alright, everything""s going to be fine.."" She heard a soft thud. Sasuke must have pressed his forehead against the door. ""Sakura,"" he called quietly, almost barely above a whisper, which sends a jolt of electricity down her spine. ""You should really go back to bed now. You still need to rest."" She cupped her slightly glowering cheeks and nodded. Realizing that he couldn""t see her, she answered, ""Alright."" Carefully, she stood up and added hesitantly, ""You""ll be staying there?"" ""..If you don""t mind."" A small smile tugged the corners of her lips.",560480
1522,"The young thirteen year old girl stood up and walked over to her master and the Elf. ""If you tell me which way they""re going, I can reach them in a matter of days."" ""But Elska,"" Cecil said, ""You are still but a child. And your apprenticeship has barely begun."" ""But you yourself said I was the best since Laylia and Slayn,"" Elska argued. ""And I want to find Magnus as much as you do. Please, let me go. I could even catch up with them before daybreak tomorrow, on my own."" ""They went by the main roads to Kannon,"" Slayn told the eager apprentice. ""Then go,"" Cecil finally said. ""Go, and may all the Spirits of the Earth assist you."" ""And may Marfa bless and protect you,"" said Queen Neese. Elska nodded, bowed to the King and Queen, and then darted off from the room to the stables. ""And let us be off on our own journey,"" said King Spark. A few hours later, the King, Queen, and their old companions set out for Valis, while Elska the apprentice sorceress rode on her steed, assisted with a speed spell, over the dunes of the desert, in search of Magnus. Transition ""We""re lost,"" Maar said as the others gathered around a tattered old map of Lodoss. ""We""re not lost,"" Gerrek insisted, ""we just don""t know where we are."" ""And you""re not helping,"" Magnus said. ""You need to do something besides complain."" ""I would, but I""m too small,"" Maar said sarcastically. ""You""re going to have to get over that too,"" Ryna told him. ""Why did you really come with us, Maar?"" ""To write the love ballad of Magnus and Princess Gemini,"" Maar said dreamily. Magnus and Gem blushed immediately. They looked at each other, and then both reached to strangle little Maar. But then a great wind rose up over them. Sand and dust whipped about them. ""What""s that!' Gem asked in her mind. ""Dragon riders,' Leaf responded. And sure enough, the shape of a great dragon flew over them, blocking the sun. Then, the first dragon was followed by three smaller dragons. Then the great dragon swept down, onto the desert floor. And gave a loud roar. And his rider, a young man with red hair and a blue bandanna, laughed. ""Well well well, what have we here? A few lost desert rats?"" said the dragon rider. ""What are you doing here in the realm of Flaim? "" asked Greegus. ""The kingdom of Moss is very far from this land."" ""I""m just takin"" a little ride with my friends,"" the young man said, thumbing over his shoulder to the other three behind him. ""And this is MY territory. Got any offerings for the dragons?"" ""I""ll give you an offering,"" Gerrek said. ""How""s about a taste of my axe?"" ""Naw thanks,"" said the leader. He scanned the group, and them smiled. ""I will take that Elf maiden."" ""Huh?"" Leaf asked, scared, ""M... Me? What do you want with me?"" ""Elves make tasty snacks for the dragons."" the leader said smiling. His lackeys behind him laughed wildly. ""Magnus, don""t let them hurt me!"" Leaf cried, cowering behind him. ""Me! I wasn""t hired to protect you,"" Magnus said. ""So much for the age of chivalry,"" Leaf responded. Suddenly, the dragons rose up into the air, and began to encircle them.",512464
396,"Meanwhile, Crash and Eddie got chased by wolves, in order to avoid getting their mother killed as well. They cut them off at a cliff, where it""s 25 feet down the ground, and as they kept running, Crash and Eddie turned around, while the wolves went forward, which made them distracted and they fell down off the cliff. They looked down and saw them falling down. They high-fived each other and that they tricked these wolves, unaware that their mother""s life is at stake. They went back to check on her to see if she""s still alive. The wolf got close to her and let out his claws and scratched her face up, then he got to her face, beat her down mercilessly, clawed her, scratched her and then, the unthinkable happened, he threw her across the air, leaped up and stabbed her in the back with his claws. Blood poured out of her back and she fell down to the ground. He growled heavily and then, went on his way, leaving a possum, bleeding and breathless. When Crash and Eddie returned to find their mom, Eddie gasped in horror as he saw their mother, bleeding and scratched up. He screamed, ""CRASH!!!"" Crash looked really worried and then, started running and then, when he saw Eddie, he looked really mortified, but when he saw their mom, he looked even more morified to see her like this. He walked silently to her, held his mom""s head, hoping that he eyes are still open. He whispered, ""Come on, mom. Wake up. Please wake up!"" He heard a groan coming from her and pleaded Eddie to come her. He ran to her and said, ""Don""t worry, mom. EVerything""s gonna be okay. We""ll still take care of you."" She panted slowly and said, ""I don""t think that""s possible. The wolves got to me, so.... I can""t live anymore."" ""No! No, NO!! PLEASE don""t say that!"" Crash pleaded. ""If you leave us, we don""t know what we""re gonna do."" Eddie said, with tears in his eyes. ""You boys will have to take care of yourselves and also, take care of Ellie. She needs you two. Promise me you""ll look after her and take care of yourselves as well."" Crash hid his face in a rock, to prevent tears falling down his eyes, but then looked at her in the eye and nodded his head, slowly. Eddie wiped the tears from his eyes, sniffled 3 times and whispered, with his voice cracking, ""We promise."" She sighed and said, ""Thank you, boys. I""m very proud to have you both as my sons. I""ll always look after you....because I--"" Then, she stopped breathing and her hand slowly hit the ground and she didn""t move anymore. Crash looked upset and tried everything he could to bring her back to life, but it was no use. She""s dead. He started breaking down, crying and Eddie looked at him with tears coming down on his face. They hugged each other while they were crying, like the one they gre close to, is gone. Back to reality... Crash woke up from this dreadful nightmare and tragic memory and felt like he could""ve done something to prevent it from happening, but he couldn""t and felt really guilty about it. He had this pathetic look on his face, like he""s been crying for several years and never stopped.",1276465
1971,"Their hands roamed over the other""s body, taking in soft curves and hard planes of muscle. Mira""s hips began to against his, causing him to grow noticeably excited. Laxus"" fingers found the strings keeping Mira""s dress on and he tugged at them. The dress didn""t fall far since there was no space between their bodies, but eventually Mira pulled away and removed it completely. Laxus had seen Mira in a bikini, many had, but seeing it this close and knowing he""d see everything soon forced him to bite his lip before stupid words fell out, like ""I love you."" He kissed her again, to force his silence as his hands skimmed over her body. He kneaded her breasts, adding a little magic for that extra tingle, before moving his hands again. Mira shivered at the feeling of sparks jumping off Laxus"" fingers across her body. Mira didn""t usually date mages, preferring to keep her professional and personal lives separate. But Laxus was converting her. She thought of all the times she hadn""t indulged in her darker fantasies, afraid they would scare off a normal man. She always played the role of sweet, innocent Mira around them. It was part of the reason it never lasted long, she felt she could never fully be herself. But Laxus had never seemed all that interested in sweet Mira. He always chased after her darker side. She smiled at the thought as she decided it was time to bring out her own magic. Laxus felt the electricity in the air before he realized what was going on. A clawed hand shoved him back onto a table. His weight smashed through it and he landed on the ground. He glared before he realized what had happened, then his eyes widened. ""Fuck me, Mira,"" Laxus"" eyes roamed over her new form. Mira gave him her most evil grin as she sauntered toward him. ""That""s what I""m doing, Laxus."" She ripped off his remaining clothing as he chuckled at her response. She straddled him, kissing him again, using her sharpened teeth to nip at his lips. Laxus responded by sending a spark of electricity through Mira""s body, causing her to squirm and arch on top of him. Laxus"" erection began poking at Mira""s entrance, Mira pouted as she removed what remained of her clothing. ""What about foreplay?"" Laxus brought his hand around to her front, his thumb to her clit. He rubbed it hard and sent another spark through her, causing Mira to scream. ""Holy fuck!"" He smirked at the sound, and when she collapsed back onto his chest, still twitching a bit, he took an earlobe into his teeth and breathed into her ear, ""Was that enough foreplay or do you want some more?"" Mira answered by grabbing his dick and impaling herself on it. Both groaned. Laxus couldn""t focus on anything but how wet and tight Mira was, his hands gripped her hips hard enough to leave bruises. Mira bit on her lip to hold in her scream, her fangs causing a trickle of blood. After a moment she began to move, rolling her hips as she moved up and down. It didn""t take long for her to find the right angle so that Laxus hit the right spot inside of her and she picked up the tempo.",1497577
3567,"He shook his head at her inability to pick up on his moods. ""Why are you here, Effie? We""re not friends, and we never will be. Just leave me the hell alone."" Haymitch then learned something about Effie that he really should have guessed earlier. She was an emotional drunk. She burst into tears at his words, throwing her head and arms on the bar. Unsure of what to do, Haymitch stood behind her and awkwardly patted her back. Suddenly she popped her head up, ""Do you hate me?"" He looked down at her; the crying had made her face a mess. He knew what she needed to hear and obliged, ""No, I don""t hate you."" She smiled and brought him in closer to her, hugging him and laying her head against his shoulder, comforted by his cool lie. What confused Haymitch was that didn""t feel like a lie. Effie did not want to see Haymitch. She had too many drinks the night before and he had put her in a cab to send her home. It had been embarrassing and unprofessional. She wanted to crawl up into a ball and stay that way forever, but she knew that wouldn""t be possible. She refused to miss this chance to go to the Victor""s Ball and to do that she needed Haymitch. So she put on her new dress and fixed her makeup and hair. She showed up at Haymitch""s hotel a half an hour early, knowing she""d need at least that amount of time to make sure he was awake and dressed. She knocked and after he didn""t answer, she opened the unlocked door. She didn""t find him anywhere in the room. She wondered where he could be. Effie wandered the halls, roaming the building, looking for Haymitch. She went to the bar first, figuring that that was her best bet for finding him. She wasn""t disappointed. He was nursing some white liquor. From a distance, he looked good enough, almost handsome. She hoped he hadn""t already reacquired his usual smell. He must have heard her approach because before she could say something he mumbled, ""What do you want, Effie?"" ""I want to go to the Victor""s Ball. I""m shocked you aren""t drunk yet and you""re ready to go."" ""You""re early."" He turned to face her. ""I""m shocked you""re ready to go considering the state you were in last night."" Effie blushed. Haymitch laughed, ""Don""t look so embarrassed. It""s nice to know you""re human."" He gestured to the stool next to him. ""Have a drink and keep my company."" The memory of the previous night still stung, so Effie refused, ""There will be plenty of that at the Ball."" Haymitch grinned as he slammed down the rest of his drink. ""You finally understand how to motivate me."" Ten minutes and Haymitch already wanted to leave. He""d found the bar within seconds and was already on drink number three. He didn""t want to remember this night. Haymitch was glad it took time to get completely drunk when he spotted a familiar face. ""Mags,"" he smiled as the old woman made her way to him. Haymitch always smiled when he saw Mags. The old woman had always held a special place in Haymitch""s heart.",1497577
2714,"Anyway, I hope I can think of another idea soon. I""m thinking of throwing Genos back in and some other heroes to still assume that the two of them are dating lol.

Fubuki waited patiently in her sister""s apartment. They were summoned by the Heroes"" Association, so it made her think that the article was a bigger deal than she thought. Were Saitama and Tatsumaki still at the Association? Or did her sister already ripped the newspaper company apart? And what the hell happened over the past few days that made the media think that the two of them were dating? She has known her sister better than anyone else, and the thought of Tatsumaki being linked to anyone was unimaginable. After a few more minutes, she heard the apartment door opening. She stood up and walked towards her sister. ""How did it go?"" Fubuki asked, curious about what went down. ""It was fine. I thought they would get mad or something. Turns out they just wanted to congratulate us."" Saitama said as he scratched the back of his head. Tatsumaki rolled her eyes as she crossed her arms. ""And, we cleared the misunderstanding. I said we""re just friends and we aren""t dating or anything."" the green-haired esper nonchalantly said, even though her cheeks were slightly smudged with pink. On the other hand, Fubuki could only blink. ""Wait, let me get one thing straight,"" she said as she rubbed her temples. ""You two are friends?"" Fubuki added, stressing the last word. Tatsumaki blinked a few times as she nodded. ""Yeah that""s what I said, didn""t I?"" she replied, as a matter-of-factly. Meanwhile, Saitama simply stood there, thinking about a huge sale in City C. The supermarket opens at 7 am, and it would surely be packed with customers. He had to get there at least an hour early. Back to the sisters, Fubuki heaved a deep sigh before talking once more. ""All my life you told me the same damn thing; to never have friends since they would only bring me down. You always insulted my group, humiliated us even! Just because of your stupid idealogy of having comrades! But if it""s you having a friend, it""s okay?! What are you trying to say?!"" Fubuki said, her cheeks red in anger. Tatsumaki was slightly taken aback as she furrowed her eyebrows. ""Unlike your so-called ""friends"", this baldy is actually useful in battle."" Tatsumaki flatly said as she pointed at Saitama. The bald hero could only mutter a ""huh?"" as he was snapped away from his thoughts about the sale. He suddenly became aware of the brewing fight between the two sisters. ""So uh...",2750536

The Emperor roared, slamming his fist down on the golden throne with every word; the force of the impacts causing earthquakes all over terra and seeming to frighten the imprisoned gods with the weight of his rage and anger. Horus however refused to cower before a tyrant. His cause was right and it would disrespect the memories of his dead or chaotic infected brothers Horus stood before his father, too frightened to run or attack; frightened of the most powerful human in existence and possibly the most powerful lifeform in the materium. Without warning, a look of remorse came over the Emperor""s face. ""Oh my son, I am so sorry. I don""t know what came over me."" As he did so, Russ sprouted several tentacles from random spots on his body; horns rising up out of his forehead and razor sharp fangs. Taking up his chainsword in a horribly mutated tentacle hand, he looked at Horus and bellowed ""BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD! SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!"" The once King of Fenris and father of the wolves charged at his brother Primarch. Horus sidestepped the attack and struck at the back of Russ""s neck with a power fist. The blow should have shattered the Primarch""s diamond hard bones into powder but with the unnatural strength of Chaos he roared and slashed at his brother like a rabid animal. The Wolf King and Master of the Luna wolves clashed in a deadly dance around their father""s throne room. Their blades clashed with enough force that they could be heard across the planet, it could even be heard over the sound of chaos infected forces, the ""loyalists"" and the last remaining untainted members of Horus""s original rebellion. The Emperor watched it all with the same non-blinking eyes.",1220273
1308,"These tests were what were readying me for this battle, and I""d be damned before I let some stupid teenager beat me down both physically and emotionally. Tsu""tey loved me, and he knew I was better than them. So, if that""s what he thinks, why can""t I believe it? Leaning my head upwards, I placed a sweet kiss onto my mate""s lips. Smiling against my own, he placed his hand upon my cheek, and held me in place; just like he would forever hold me in his heart. Wainfleet""s P.O.V Almost the whole base had been called into the cafeteria for a debriefing by Quaritch. In my opinion it was to damn early in the morning for this shit. All I wanted to do was go pass out in my cot for a few extra hours. However, it seemed as if the big man had other ideas. ""What do you think this shit""s all about,"" Fike asked coming to stand beside me. ""Who the hell knows? Quaritch""s been walking around like he""s got a stick up his ass ever since Dr. Augustine and her crew escaped. For all we know he could be threatening us not to help them,"" I grumbled rubbing the back of my neck, trying to alleviate the throbbing ache it was producing. It didn""t help that my eye still hurt either from a few weeks previous when that little bitch had tried to put her finger through its socket. There was a scratch still healing in the corner too. Not to mention that little cunt had practically torn through the flesh in my hands with her teeth; this of course had earned me a stitch or two. I swore that if I ever get my hands on her again I""d kill her. I should have done it when we went to retrieve her, and those other green-peace freaks, from their camp. However, Momma Bear made sure to keep a close eye on her cub the entire time she""d been here. There wasn""t even a moment where someone wasn""t with her. If it wasn""t her crippled brother looking after her, then it was that geek; Spellman. Needless to say, I hadn""t gotten my chance at revenge yet, but the moment we find her again...well you better bet she""ll be screaming my name by the end, if not pleading for her life. The crowd quieted as Quaritch walked into the room. Coming to stand in front of the windows, he took a moment get his bearings before speaking to us in whole. ""Everyone on this base, every one of you, is fighting for survival. That""s a fact,"" he declared. I watched as the screens to the windows closed, covering the room in complete darkness. However, Quaritich didn""t even flinch. He merely aimed the remote control in his hand at the projector, and turned it on. Behind him, came to life a visual screen, showing a piece of land on Pandora. Little yellow dots stood out in certain places; some more than others though. ""There""s an aboriginal horde out there massing for an attack. Now, these orbital images tell me that the hostiles"" numbers have gone from a few hundred..."" with a flick of his hand the picture behind him changed, and the yellow dots had grown to take over the entire screen almost, ""...to well over 2,000 in one day. And more are pouring in.""",806976
648,"Most of the time she""s spent her recovery curled up next to my son. Those two are quite the couple,"" Sara said throwing in that little quip so as to make me realize my closeness next to Diego. Yeah those old feelings were definitely still there, and I was sure I was feeling some from him as well. ""Well that""s great. When her grandmother told me what was going on it sounded almost as if she was terminal. I""m going to guess they managed to remove the tumor without any trouble,"" Diego questioned looking between her and me. ""Yep, they said I was lucky that it didn""t spread,"" I smiled at him all the while knowing I was making those love bird eyes at him, not meaning to. ""That""s good,"" he smiled turning to look at me as his eyes gazed into mine. Finally he pulled them away and went to take a bite of his waffles. I watched him carefully as Sara went to check on the others in the living room and let them know there was someone here. ""So how have you been Mr. Marine,"" I asked leaning my head onto my hands as I kept my eyes upon him. ""I""ve been better. Afghanistan can really get to a guy you know. It will haunt your dreams day and night, and the ghosts of the ones you""ve killed will never let you forget them. It""s awful over there Shay. I mean I know you want to join the Air force and all, but please don""t. I don""t think I could stand seeing you go through what I""ve been dealing with lately,"" Diego said as his true feelings finally appeared on his face. With a comforting look I laid my hand upon his and squeezed. ""I""m here for you, Diego. I always have been,"" I whispered to him as I leaned my head on his shoulder. ""I know, and that""s why I love you,"" he replied as he turned his head and placed a gently kiss on the top of my head. ""Shay,"" came a voice from behind us. Turning I found Matt glaring at Diego with daggers in his eyes. ""Oh Matt, this is Diego. He""s a friend of mine. He just found out from my grandmother what""s been going on and he decided to rush to save me apparently,"" I said with a playful glare his way. ""A friend huh,"" Matt said not at all convinced. ""I""m her ex actually,"" Diego said finally turning to look at him with a challenging gaze. Figure""s, they were boys. ""He""s in the marine""s so I""m pretty sure he won""t be here long. I""m pretty sure he also escaped from their clutches since he""s not wearing his civilian clothing,"" I replied as I let my eyes roam over his uniform. Matt walked into the kitchen further and took a seat right next to me as he wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me in for a kiss. When we broke away I noticed Diego trying to keep his true emotions hidden, but just from the look in his eyes I knew he wanted to slug Matt. ""So I heard you had cancer to Matt. How""s that working out for you,"" Diego jested with a hidden smirk as he took a bite of his waffles. Before Matt could answer everyone else came tumbling into the kitchen to meet the guest. ""Dude he""s a marine,"" Billy smiled as he took a seat next to Diego. ""Hey, little man, and who are you,"" Diego asked ruffling Billy""s hair.",806976
30,"The guy was amazingly hot, with midnight black hair, pale blue eyes, and a chiseled face... Yeah, it was unfair how handsome he was. ""Are you injured?"" He frowned. ""Here, let me..."" He picked her up, bridal style. ""Thank you. I""m sure I""m heavy..."" ""Not at all."" Handsome, kind and strong; if he could play violin and cook, Lyra would never let him go. ""Lyra...! Who are you?!"" Ulrich stepped into the room. ""Ricky! Isn""t this a friend of yours; he came out of your cylinder thingies."" Ulrich stiffened then turned to the bespectacled blonde boy- Jeremy. ""A specter?"" ""Highly likely. But he isn""t being hostile..."" ""You both are not far off. I am composed of several specters and a few organic codes gathered from your various visits to Lyoko."" Ulrich frowned and glared at the guy holding her. ""Give me back my sister."" ""She is injured and unable to function her leg properly. Allow me to-"" ""Allow me to throttle you. Give her back!"" Lyra frowned. ""Ricky, he""s just being nice..."" ""He""s a stranger- ever heard of stranger danger?"" ""Ever heard of over protective. Just have him take me upstairs; my first aid kit is still in my backpack, I think. Mom would flip if I didn""t have one with me at all times..."" Ulrich sighed. ""Fine; but he""s still dangerous."" ""And you""re still overreacting."" Ulrich watched as Aelita expertly wrapped Lyra""s ankle out of his peripheral vision. The mystery guy from the scanners- Mr. Specter- sat docile as Jeremy waved a scanner around him. ""Interesting..."" ""What is?"" Ulrich asked. ""He is composed of several specters- but only to fill in the key gaps in his DNA code. He""s pretty much as solid as any of us."" ""And what about the scanner thing? How did he activate a scanner without tripping an alarm."" Jeremy seemed at a loss. ""Well, my theory is that he bypassed the frame codes and-"" ""I say he""s a XANA super-specter!"" Odd exclaimed. Ulrich nodded. ""Makes more sense."" ""Well, then why not attack Aelita or any of us?"" Yumi asked. ""The Hopper specter was pretty docile and even tempered too."" Ulrich pointed out. ""He has to be a specter to be that good looking."" Odd frowned. ""Why is it that all the beautiful people are specters?"" ""I""m not a specter; are you saying I""m not beautiful, Odd?"" Yumi joked. ""That goes for me, too, Odd."" Aelita laughed. ""You""re all bandaged up, Lyra."" ""Thanks, Aelita."" She stood cautiously and tapped her foot tentatively on the ground. ""So who are you, mystery boy?"" Mr. Specter straightened at Lyra""s question. He reddened slightly. ""I am a specter-organic hybrid, able to exist separately from the supercomputer and my father""s influence."" ""Father?"" parroted just about everyone. Specter guy lowered his head. ""Yeah... XANA is my creator... Hence my father. I was created out of XANA""s will to create a backup in case you guys succeeded in eradicating him."" ""Wait, what?"" Lyra said. ""I""m not following, like, any of this. Anyone here speaking human?"" ""Amazing... XANA managed to create a human..."" ""Not human. Barely human. Actually, I""m more remnant of a clone ... Is anyone following?"" Aelita raised her hand.",3439302
1202,"Not in a dress, plunked at a table with several other socialites, as her mother had hoped. Riding with her friends, all boys, the Goonies. ""Hey, everyone!"" Mr. Walsh waved as they passed the museum. Tall, thin, and balding, Mr. Walsh was the nicest man Elle had ever met. She felt a surge of pity towards him- he shouldn""t have to lose his house to rich idiots like the Perkins. This made her more determined than ever to find Willy""s treasure. ""Hey, Mr. Walsh!"" they all called in turn. Everyone followed Mikey, because they all assumed he knew where he was going, but actually, he didn""t. So he led them to the local drugstore to find a current map of Astoria. ""Um, Mikey? Please tell me this isn""t where the rich stuff is,"" Elle said. ""It""s not,"" Mikey assured her, letting his bike fall on the curb. ""I just have to check something-"" he scurried inside, everyone else on his heels. But once they were in, everyone went their seperate ways- Elle and Mouth to the magazines and Chunk and Data to the junk food. ""Oh my God,"" Elle heard Mikey say. ""I know these rocks, I know where this is! Guys! Check it out! I know how to get there, this is Astoria, this is where the rich stuff""s buried- guys! We can go there, we can get the rich stuff-!"" ""Jerk alert!"" Mouth called over the latest issue of Boudoir. At first Elle thought Mouth had meant the cashier, who was trying to bargain with Data. But then she looked past him and saw- ""Troy!"" Data said disgustedly. Tall, athletic, and handsome, Troy strode in with an air of confidence that could rival any businessman""s. He was accompanied by two high school girls. A bell of recognition rang in Elle""s head. She""d seen them before. What were their names? Andy and Stef. Both girls scoped out an arcade game nearby as Troy walked around. Then he spotted Mouth. He snatched the magazine from his hands. ""Jerk!"" Mouth said. ""Come on, Mouth, let""s get out of here,"" Elle tugged on his sleeve. Mouth melted away to the games while Elle went to Mikey, who was still poring over the maps. Troy followed them, about to harass them some more, but then he saw Chunk, pigging out in the ice cream display. He was hunched over, half his body dangling inside the freezer. Troy lifted the cover and pressed it on Chunk. Chunk never saw Troy pull the lid but he felt it alright and squealed like a stuck pig. ""Hey, my mom""s making a Goon Pizza tonight-"" he started. ""Cut it out!"" Mikey said. When Troy didn""t obey, Mikey abandoned Elle and the maps and squeezed himself in between Troy and Chunk and pushed him away. ""Cut it out man, it""s not cool!"" ""What""s this? You""re a Goonie, telling me what to do?"" he held Mikey by his jacket collar. Then his eyes fell on Elle. She crimsoned and moved to block the maps. ""Well, you""re a pretty little thing, aren""t you? What""re you hiding behind you there?"" Mouth moved closer to the scene, just in case Troy did something stupid. ""Nothing."" Elle tried to make her voice as stable and firm as possible. ""Come on, show me."" ""No."" That wasn""t a word Troy was familiar with.",2855986
2750,"""Yeah,"" Hisoka pulled himself closer to Tsuzuki""s chest, his hands were lightly shaking from nervousness. Not one to admit his own insecurities that easily, he looked for comfort in the only person he knew he could count on. ""It""s time to go try mixing in with the crowds again,"" Tsuzuki""s voice was soft, ""I know its hard, but I swear I""ll protect you."" A sigh escaped Hisoka""s lips. Tsuzuki was talking about the ""training sessions"" in the realm of the living. They were trying to slowly introduce Hisoka to other people of various sizes, not only to help his mind sort out the insane emotion overload thing, but also to help cure him of the fear he seemed to retain for people in general. Hisoka""s voice seemed frantic, pleading and out of character for him. ""Tsuzuki, I... We don""t have to go up there, right? Can""t we just skip it for today and stay here, together? Please? We have lots of time to-"" Tsuzuki paused Hisoka""s talking with his finger, a worried look matched his feelings. ""Don""t be afraid, Hisoka."" Tilting Hisoka""s head up towards his face, ""I""m right here, okay?"" A gentle kiss locked Hisoka""s attention towards his partner, and also calming his nerves down immensely. The only person he didn""t seem to be afraid of, was his quirky partner. The park during the middle of the afternoon on a weekday was usually pretty sparce. Those who weren""t working either had the day off, or probably never had a job to begin with. Slightly cloudly and with the sun peaking through, the day all in all, wasn""t too bad. Hisoka felt like a clingy child at the moment, holding ontoTsuzuki""s arm like the sky was falling. Tsuzuki, however, just responded with gentle touches for silent encourgment. He wasn""t sure if he would ever get used to the new feelings he felt from strangers, but there was always hope. ""I wonder why Muraki did this? Why... Why did he-"" Hisoka was stoped by a gentle shushing motion. ""Focus on the task at hand, okay? What do you feel now?"" Tsuzuki scanned the area, two people in the distance, and another dog walker on the other side of the path. Hisoka closed his eyes, ""I feel... you, and... others. Many others, but there emotions still feel distant. Some are closer, the three people in eye sight. Ones angry, the... dogwalkerI think. And..."" His eyes flew open and a blush ran across his face. ""Um..... the other two are... somewhat, busy, at the moment..."" Tsuzuki couldn""t help but laugh, giving the blonde a rough pat on the head. He turned Hisoka""s head towards him, eyes connecting together. ""Focus just on me, Hisoka. You know I love you, my feelings are always strong. ""Hestitantly, Hisoka nodded. xxxIt was like this, that Tsuzuki and I spent the day. We spent many days together and although I feel that my fear of humans may have passed, I believe I""m becoming too dependant on Tsuzuki. I haven""t told him yet, what I think, but if Muraki knew this weakness... I fear what he could do to me. I don""t want to know, I don""t want to even think about what sick and twisted games he wants to play with my body this time. It makes me sick.",583994
3739,"The brunette stood there, speechless at what was happening. It""s too late, she thought. Too late to make everything okay. Too late for them. ""What? I thought she was going to arrive tomorrow? Are they that eager to marry their princess off?"" James said, almost yelling at his father. ""You and I are both surprised, James. Believe me."" he replied. James wanted to say a lot of things to his father, but he can""t arrange the thoughts in his head. ""I""m in love with someone else, dad."" he blurted out suddenly, catching Sofia off guard and the king surprised. James, realizing what he just said, was a bit flushed. How can he say to his father that the person he would love to be his queen was his own stepsister? His father would laugh at him and pat him on the back, muttering that ""it was a good joke"" or something like that. But of course, he has to say it. It was now or- Knock knock Upon hearing the knock, James"" thoughts became jumbled again. ""Come in, please."" King Roland said, still a bit shocked by his son""s sudden confession. As the door opened, two guards of a different kingdom went inside and stood by the doorways as a lady entered. She was utterly beautiful; her curled, golden brown locks seemed to be flowing behind her as she walked gracefully, like she was dancing on air. And as every lady does, she sported the daintiest smile she could showcase. The smile of a princess. ""Your Highness! We would like to welcome Princess Emilia of Rouerie!"" one of the castle""s servants said. Graciously, princess Emilia bowed down to show respect to King Roland. In return, the King of Enchancia bowed downs as well to show courtesy. ""I, King Roland, gladly accepts your visit, Princess Emilia of Rouerie."" King Roland placed his gaze on his son as he signaled him to come forward. Reluctantly, James walked towards them and bowed down politely. ""And this is my son, Prince James of Enchancia. And of course my stepdaughter, Princess Sofia."" Upon hearing her name, Sofia instantly bowed down quickly, smiling lightly at the princess. ""She look so beautiful. She looks exactly like what a princess is.' she thought with a hint of sadness. ""It""s a pleasure to finally meet you, Prince James."" Emilia said, bowing down once more. ""I uh... the pleasure is mine, Princess Emilia."" James replied. ""Well then, my servants shall lead you to your quarters, Princess Emilia. We shall call for you once dinner will be served."" King Roland said with a smile, signaling some of his servants to guide their guest to her room. She smiled once more before walking out of the king""s office, following the servants as they led her to her room. As they were all out of the office, Sofia, James and King Roland were once again left inside. With a small sigh, King Roland faced James with a frown. ""You should""ve told me you had someone you fancied, James. How are we going to turn down Princess Emilia""s marriage meeting?"" ""I didn""t thought you""d approve of it."" James muttered quietly, almost a whisper. ""Why? Why do you think I""d disapprove of it? Is she a commoner?"" The king asked.",2750536
3123,"""Is there anything else you can remember about this place that might possibly save our lives?"" he asked. ""Well besides the bronze it""s said to be surrounded a three-fold layer of night."" Percy stared at her. ""Who said that? Because you can tell them that it doesn""t make any sense."" ""It was in a poem written by Hesiod. He wrote a lot about Tartarus and the Underworld. He also said-"" suddenly her face turned pale. ""What? What is it?"" ""Percy,"" she started hesitantly. Do you remember how long we were falling?"" He frowned. ""What? I dunno... maybe an hour? It was hard to tell. Why?"" ""Because he also wrote that if you fall into Tartarus from Earth it takes nine days."" ""But that""s impossible! We weren""t falling for nine days!"" ""We might""ve been. Maybe something bent the time so it felt shorter to us, like in the Labyrinth."" ""You mean on the outside nine days might have already passed?"" ""I don""t know! I don""t know! Maybe Hesiod was wrong."" ""He was right about the bronze wall,"" Percy said darkly. ""Well, the only thing we can do now is reach the doors of death."" So, Percy set off again, making sure to keep the wall on one side of him at all times. After a few more minutes, Annabeth stopped him again. ""Percy, wait! Is that my knife?"" She cried pointing at something lying on the ground. Percy stooped over and picked it up. It was indeed her knife, the only object he hadn""t recovered when exploring the cavern before. ""Oh thank the gods!"" Annabeth said. (In Percy""s opinion, she was way too excited about a knife, but it had been with her since she was seven.) ""Here,"" she said, capping Riptide and handing it back to him. ""My knife gives off just as much light and it""s a lot easier to hold."" Once again, they continued, making slow progress along the wall. Percy wondered about what Annabeth had said. Was it possible that nine days had already passed? If it was true, the others might already be at the other doors of death, fighting for their lives. And we still have to make it past tons of monsters and Gaea""s supporters to reach them! Plus, he had no idea how they were even going to find the doors of death. Unless Hades had installed one of those helpful ""you are here"" maps like in malls, getting lost was pretty much inevitable. And then there was the problem that Annabeth could hardly stand, let alone fight. It would be hours more before the ambrosia kicked in enough for her to even walk without pain. He had to find a way to heal her, preferably soon. A horrible cry suddenly brought Percy out of his thoughts. It was like the voice of a woman, but not quite. He had it before, but where? In the moment it took him to place it, Annabeth had already frozen against his back. ""Arachne,"" she whispered, terror clear in voice. ""How? When I saw her I think she was almost dead. She was hardly moving!"" Percy told her urgently. ""She must have survived and found a way to get out of the trap!"" Percy glanced behind him, at Annabeth""s face. He really didn""t want to fight anything with her like this. If anything happened to him, they would never get out of this alive.",2943978
1323,"Andy got up and stood there with her eyes closed and all other senses opened. Suddenly Andy felt a sudden breeze coming toward her and in one swift move she opened out her arm and caught Callisto by the throat and squeezed while her hand heated up. Callisto let out a blood-curdling scream as she fell to the floor. Part of her neck was burnt. Not badly enough to leave a scar, but it would scar. It had to hurt. ""You bitch,"" Callisto said looking at her. ""What can I say I learned from the best,"" Andy said. ""FUEGA,"" a voice rang out. Andy turned and saw Magneto waving a hand for her to come over. ""Sorry my boss needs me sweetie,"" Andy said sarcastically with a smirk that resembled Callisto""s almost. Andy walked out of there while dusting her shoulders off. She was still the top bitch around here and she let everyone know it too. ""Yes,"" Andy said. ""Follow me. I need to have talk with you,"" Andy nodded and followed him into the forest. ""Now that Mystique is gone, you know you""re my right hand woman now,"" Andy nodded and Magneto turned to her. ""That means you have to take on her responsibilities. I need to you to help me with this,"" Magneto said handing her a folder. Andy looked inside and saw that it was some criminal records. ""What are these for,"" Andy asked looking up. ""I need you to break these mutants out for me. One of our mutants refuses to cooperate till we get her brothers out,"" Andy sighed and said, ""Fine, is that all."" ""No,"" Magneto said shaking his head as he continued, ""You need to start training Callisto, like Mystique trained you. If anything happens to you then Callisto is next in line."" ""Magneto I can""t. She""s a bitch and I""ll kill her,"" Andy said practically yelling. ""Oh come now, she""s not that awful,"" Magneto said with a chuckle. ""Did you not see what I just did to her,"" Andy asked pointing behind her back at camp where Quill was fighting Multiple Man now. ""Yes and maybe that finally put her in her place,"" Magneto said. ""Not likely,"" Andy said under her breath. ""Come on my dear. I trust that you""ll do right. If she causes a problem then come to me,"" Magneto said patting her shoulder, ""As for this that I just gave you, I""m not going to put you through much hell so I""m sending Gambit with you to help."" ""Oh yes, and he""s not hell,"" Andy said rolling her eyes. ""You know you""re starting to sound more and more like Mystique every day my dear,"" Magneto said. Andy rolled her eyes and quickly excused herself to get Gambit and take him with her to the prison. A few hours later they were in a helicopter with Andy flying. Mystique had taught her how to fly it not to long ago, incase something ever happened to her. ""So why does he need us to break them out again,"" Gambit yelled over the roaring of the wind. ""So that we can get one of ours to cooperate,"" Andy yelled. ""And he put me and you together why?"" he yelled. ""Because he""d thought it would be funny I guess,"" Andy yelled back sarcastically. Andy slowly landed the plane and they were immediately met with guns. Andy jumped out along with Gambit and they immediately went to work.",806976

891,"All had stood in the grand reception hall from the morning until nearly midnight, but she never showed. Celeste was hoping, for Erik""s sake, that this feindly soprano had changed her mind. However, it wasn""t to be. The woman arrived in the middle of rehearsal. As the orchestra and the leading tenor, Benedetto, were rehearsing ""La donna e mobile"", Senior Fetine, the manager, came running in as if the Devil was at his heels. ""She is here!"" he screamed, ""Hurry! Hurry! She""s just come and she""s furious!"" Celeste, along with he colleagues, left their instruments and seats and hurried out of the pit and up between the seats and aisles, and out the doors to the reception hall. Then, the dancers, the other singers, and the backstage crew piled in from every door and direction as Senior Fetine led a woman into the theatre. She was of middling height, and had hair so red it was obviously either dyed or a wig. Her outfit was a mass of black colored fur and feathers. Her face showed her age, with crows"" feet enhanced, rather than hidden, by her make up. It was possible this woman could have been a little pretty in her youth, but whatever had happened to her as an adult had done a great deal of damage to her looks. ""Madams and Monsiuers, Seniors and Senioras, please welcome out new first Soprano, Seniora Carlotta Gudicelli."" Fetine said, letting go of his Carlotta""s hand and clapping. Everyone started clapping wildly immediately... except Celeste, but she caught on and clapped hard. ""Thank you, thank you,"" Carlotta said in an overly thick accent. She shed her enormous coat (though why she needed it in summer was a mystery to Celeste) and curtsied, waving as if she were a lost queen returned to her kingdom. ""I am-a honored to be-a welcomed so-a warmly een-a my-a mother country,"" she said, smiling. Then, in less time than it takes to blink, she burst into tears and wailed. ""Oh! If-a only my-a darling Ubaldo were-a here! My heart, she weeps for-a all eternity!"" then she produced a larger than life hanky and blew her nose. It was louder than a tuba, but made the same sound as one. As she cried, she looked at the assembled crew and frowned, then said, ""What are-a you looking at! Go away!"" As many stated to leave, a man from the orchestra, breaking from the throng and walking up to Carlotta said, ""We all offer our condolences, Seniora."" He was shorter than most everyone, but not a dwarf, and had a mustache that was styled to curl up under his nose. On his head sat a toupee that in no way whatsoever could have passed for his own hair. He took Carlotta""s hand and kissed it, then said, gazing at her adoringly, ""Bella Flora, great beauty of the age, O gracious muse, please do excuse their lack of concern. Please dry your tears from your spellbinding eyes. Instead let your smile return."" The actress giggled, and asked Fetine, ""Who ees this-a charming man? I hope I have-a the pleasure of sharing the stage with-a him."" ""Terribly sorry, Seniora,"" Fetine said, ""He is Enri Gaucinii, our accomplished first chair violinist.""",512464
3096,"""Hey, no! You still owe me for that Luke Skywalker model you broke last spring-"" ""That was an accident, how many times do I have to tell you?"" Cary retorted impatiently. ""And I didn""t break it, for God""s sake, I just burned the arm a little-"" ""A little? His hand is missing!"" ""It wasn""t my fault!"" ""Ah, yes, but I seem to recall that it was your firecracker."" Cary pounced on Joe with renewed energy. Alice, who was sitting across from them, shook her head in disbelief. But luckily, she was prepared. She reached into her canvas bag and pulled out a small spray bottle. ""Bad Cary!"" she sprayed him. ""No fighting with Joe in public!"" Cary shook his head wildly, trying to rid his hair of the water drops. ""Will you please stop using that?"" he said in an exasperated voice. ""Not until you""ve learned your lesson,"" Alice replied tartly. ""But-"" She sprayed him again. ""I was just-"" Another burst or water. ""Alright, alright! Jeez."" ""Charles, you next."" Joe passed the toy to him, the barest trace of a grin on his face. ""Awesome. Alright... Magic 8 Ball, will I win the film festival next summer?"" Charles shook it. ""All signs point to yes!"" he read gleefully. There was a little ""hmph"" from Cary. ""Alice?"" he offered the ball to her. ""Sure. Okay... erm... will Cary ever behave like a human being?"" After a few seconds, she burst out laughing. ""What? What?"" her friends prodded her. ""Very doubtful!"" she showed them. ""One day, I will sue Mattel for all they""ve got,"" Cary muttered darkly. Friends + 8 ball = this. Peaceskies! ""Checkmate!"" Alice said triumphantly, knocking down Cary""s king. ""Nooo! You cheated!"" Cary accused her. ""Call it whatever you want... at least I""m not the one who moves their pieces when their opponent isn""t looking."" Cary glared at her. ""Well, let""s play poker. At least with cards I have half a chance."" ""Does it matter?"" Joe asked over his math homework. Originally they were going to go to the park, but Joe and Charles still had Mr. Dunn""s work to finish. Alice and Cary had already finished in class, much to Joe""s amazement. Mr. Dunn lectured so long that there were usually only about ten minutes left to complete their work. In the meantime, Alice and Cary were playing a number of games on the coffee table im Joe""s living room. ""Yes,"" Cary replied matter-of-factly. ""No one ever beats Cary the Awesome at poker."" ""Okay, but let me warn you... I""m not very good,"" Alice said as Cary dealed a worn deck of cards. ""That""s okay, you get better as you keep playing... Okay, so the amount to stay in is a dime for now. Alice, do you wanna call, raise, or fold?"" Cary asked. Joe rolled his eyes and went back to geometry. ""Right, so I""ve got 206 degrees for angle C."" He furrowed his brow a few minutes later. ""That can""t be right. Charles, what did you get?"" ""Uh-"" he consulted his paper- ""67."" ""How?"" ""The Pythagorean Theorem."" ""That""s what I used!"" ""Well, if you got the wrong answer, then you used it wrong."" ""Obviously."" ""Then why are you telling me this?"" ""Never mind,"" Joe said hastily, trying to avoid a fight. ""I""ll just look it up.""",2855986
2484,"Thankfully, the contents didn""t contain an invitation to an event she wouldn""t want to attend, but a simple birth announcement sent as a matter of obligation. Her eyes glanced over the beautifully produced engraving that proclaimed that Jacob and Gabrielle Kane were now the proud parents of twin daughters, Katherine and Elizabeth. A professional photograph of the new family slipped from the envelope, and she made sure to tilt it so Jim could see its seemingly innocuous contents. He recognized the man, as anyone who had spent any time in Gotham would. ""You know Jake Kane?"" ""He""s a cousin,"" she told him. ""My family""s been in Gotham for a long time, and all the old Gotham families are related. I don""t really know him, but it""s the way Gotham society works. People send announcements like this all the time in order to extort gifts from distant relatives."" Jim gave her a tired smile. ""Society etiquette at its best."" ""Indeed,"" she agreed. Jim smothered a yawn, and she wisely took his glass away from him. He had barely touched the wine, and his eyes were at half-mast with fatigue. ""I""m ready for bed,"" he admitted. ""You coming?"" ""In a bit. I need to finish a couple of things."" If Jim had been in the mood for sex, he would have made a play to persuade her to join him. Instead, he rose to his feet and kissed her goodnight. She watched as he went to their bedroom, frowning in concern. Absentmindedly, she finished off his leftover wine before refilling the glass. Her mother had always said white wine didn""t keep well after opening, and Barbara hated seeing things go to waste. As soon as she was done the bottle, she would go keep Jim company as he slept. Rising to her feet, she moved to put the mail away so she wouldn""t awaken to a mess. In the process, her fingers brushed against the picture of the happy Kane family. It was yet another item to store in her scrapbook of family memorabilia. Barbara had told Jim the truth, but she hadn""t really explained what that truth meant. In Gotham, all the major families were related. Barbara""s great-grandfather had been a younger son of Hezekiah Kane, and had split with his father over a difference of religion. In a fit of pique, he""d changed the spelling and pronunciation of his name and became the first Kean in Gotham. It wasn""t an uncommon story for the Gotham blue bloods. There was no reason to point out that Martha Wayne""s maiden name had been Kane. Gotham may have been a city that acted on whim, but it was also a city with patience. Sometimes she struck swiftly, using surprise to make things interesting. But Gotham also understood the appeal of the long con, allowing people to lull themselves into a false sense of security. The day Tommy was taken into her final embrace, joining his ancestors in the Wayne graveyard, she made sure the sun was shining brightly in the skies. There was a weather system off to the west that should have arrived, but Gotham defied expectations and made sure the rain didn""t come.",1112924
1301,"Tatsumaki""s fingers slightly shook, but she managed to restrain the monster by adding a little more of her concentration. ""You okay Tats?"" she heard Saitama ask. ""Like hell I wouldn""t be"" Tatsumaki replied brashly. ""Saya-chan!"" a girl""s voice came from behind them, making Tatsumaki turned her head slightly behind. It was another kid running towards them and then stopped a few meters away from them. ""O-onee-chan..."" the young girl being held by the clown mumbled helplessly. Out of nowhere, a whole lot of emotions opened within Tatsumaki. When she stared back at the clown, all she could see was a young Fubuki crying feebly at the monster""s mercy. ""Let... her... go."" she muttered angrily, making Saitama glance at her. ""Tatsumaki?"" he muttered. ""Let the kid go, you ugly, miserable fuck!"" she screamed as she glowed green and floated upwards and manipulated the clown""s movements. Because of her sudden movement, the knife was about to hit the girl but within a second, Saitama was able to shield her. But in return, the knife stabbed the bald hero. Tatsumaki flinched and then came to her senses as she floated back down and lifted the clown up in the air before throwing him back down with an immense amount of force that he was dug deep on the ground. ""Saita- "" Tatsumaki placed her attention on him when she realized that the stab had no effect on Saitama. At all. The young girl was still in his arms when he pulled the knife from his back and dropped it on the ground, meters away from the clown. ""What happened Tats? The kid almost got stabbed."" Saitama said. His voice nor his facial expression didn""t show any emotions. Tatsumaki released a breath she didn""t realize she was holding as she knelt on her knees, exhausted. She exerted a lot of her powers on this one, even though she shouldn""t be. ""Saya-chan! I""m sorry for letting you out of my sight!"" The older girl said as she ran towards her sister and hugged her tight. The younger girl, Saya, was released from Saitama""s hold as she hugged her sister back. ""Onee-chan... I was so scared..."" the kid mumbled. The older girl looked up at Saitama and grinned. ""Thank you very much, hero-san! Thank you!"" Saitama smiled slightly as he patted the girl""s head. ""I""m only doing my job as a hero."" he said before turning his attention back at Tatsumaki. ""You okay?"" he asked and extended a hand towards her. She stared at it but didn""t accepted his help. ""Yeah."" she replied and stood up by herself. Saitama wanted to ask her what happened, but decided to ask her some other time. He realized that the two siblings somehow got to her and asking her questions now might trigger something. ""A hell of a day huh? Wanna grab some udon?"" he offered as she shook her head in reply. ""I""m not hungry. I""ll just go home."" ""Want me to come with you or-"" ""I told you, you can stop watching over me now! I can take care of myself and I am assuring you that I won""t use my powers for the remaining days of the week!"" Tatsumaki said as she looked up at him angrily. Saitama blinked and then knocked her head lightly. ""You""re crying again.""",2750536
2726,"I asked, trying to keep up a conversation without him noticing that I am pretty much thinking deep about something. ""Nothing much. What did you talk about with Chitanda-san yesterday? I mean, any club plans?"" I gulped. Satoshi is asking what happened yesterday. What should I say? ""Nothing. Chitanda was just being her usual self, as usual."" ""What is she curious about this time?"" I made another gulp. Does this guy know what happened yesterday? I tried to compose myself without anyone noticing. ""Something that I can""t really relate to."" I replied. It""s quite true. I really can""t relate about romance and stuff. ""Did you answer her questions correctly?"" I think I just blushed. Have I given Chitanda the correct answer? She seems satisfied with my answers anyway. ""Yeah."" I replied coolly. Satoshi gave me a nod, and I sighed mentally in relief. Right, keep yesterday a secret from everybody. That would be a piece of cake. I am not much of a talker anyway. We reached the gate of our school when Ibara rushed to us. ""Morning, Fuku-chan!"" She said. Satoshi gave her his usual grin. I looked away and let them be alone for a while. Plus, it""s a perfect opportunity to dodge Ibara""s questions. I went on towards the shoe lockers. After placing my indoor shoes on, I of course went straight ahead to my classroom. See? Everything is perfectly normal. Or so I thought it was. While making my way to the stairs, I saw Chitanda going down. Well, of course I paused. Her hypnotizing eyes, which I always avoid, looked as surprised as I was. She blushed and looked down, which I presume is because of our awkward meet up. ""Hey."" Damn, I unconsciously said. What am I thinking? Chitanda looked up and bowed at me. ""G-good morning, O-Oreki-san... Please p-pardon me."" She said then went on with her walking. I nodded and went on as well. After seeing her so distressed at the stairs, I felt really bad and... weird? Well I don""t know... All I know is that, I am dragging myself to my classroom. This day couldn""t get any worse. Classes are over and it""s time for the club meeting. I went up to our room, practically dragging myself. I guess it""s still early because no one is inside. I went in, placed my bag on the table, sat down on a chair, and continued reading a book. I guess I was really engrossed in the book, because the next thing I knew was Satoshi and Ibara""s entrance. ""Look""s like someone""s eager for a club meeting!"" Satoshi said, obviously referring to me. ""Shut up."" I said in reply. He chuckled then sat down. I never looked up though. I think Ibara did the same thing too. ""How was the History Test, Fuku-chan?"" ""It went okay. I think I aced it thanks to your help!"" The two carried on their conversation. I just read on. Maybe a few minutes went by, the sliding door opened and revealed Chitanda, trying to catch her breath. ""I-I am so sorry I am late, everyone!"" she politely said as she bowed down. ""No worries, Chi-chan!"" Ibara said in an apologetic way. And yet when I am late, she goes all mad at me. I just made a simple stare at them, and then returned to my book.",2750536
699,"""Oh, he let me go when I told him what I saw,"" Averill stopped just short of me, breathless and smiling, ""Six men, all on horseback, in the colors of House Lannister and House Targaryen! That sellsword friend of yours was with them, Synne. They""ll be down the road soon, come from Lord Allyrion""s castle!"" I felt a wave of nervousness wash over me. They were here, already? From what little I knew, shouldn""t it take longer to travel through Dorne from a city as far away as King""s Landing in a carriage? Unless they went straight here, taking a ship across the strait and the rest on just horseback, but that would be insane for some soft-bellied noble. Then again, from the few stories I""d heard of Tyrion Lannister, he was anything but soft. I stood from the wheat piled, shaking like a leaf, ""I... I... M-Maenys, may I...?"" ""Go, go you fool girl,"" Maenys shooed me, a motherly look on her face, ""Go home, calm yourself, pretty yourself, whatever you need to do, just go."" Then she eyed her daughter, ""And you are going to take her place for a spell."" Averill groaned. I could tell she wanted to see the Hand of the King closer up too, but we were working at the head of the field before the house. She""d see them long before I would. Knowing I didn""t have a lot of time but not wanting to appear panting and exhausted from running, I walked as swiftly as I could back to my shack. Inside, Florys leaped from my hammock and circled me, sensing my excitement and frayed nerves. I set about trying to somehow make the shack more presentable for someone as important as the Hand of the King. Brushed off the small wooden table my mother hammered together with cast-off pieces from the local smithy, tried to somehow smooth out the dirt floor a bit more, closed mine and my mother""s small trunks of belongings, and removing the drying rack full of rabbit and herbs outside, around the back of the shack. The last thing I did was brush off Mother""s tiny headstone. I hesitated a moment, then flipped it and washed it off with a little cloth and some water from the nearest irrigation canal. It now read ""Tysha"" instead of ""Myrna"". Just as I finished that, I heard the hooves behind me. I couldn""t make out too many details from here, but six horses had stopped at the Eddars house. Four tall men I didn""t recognize, a fifth I could barely make out as Bronn, and a much shorter sixth on the grandest horse. They were a mess of blacks, golds, and reds. My heart leaped to my throat as nervousness took over. I darted inside just as the first horse turned towards my shack, Florys hot on my heels. For a moment, I paced. For another, I leaned against the shuttered window. Then, finally, took a spot on the hammock and messed with the frayed edges of its rough burlap. The sound of hooves ended just outside, then the sounds of dismounting men. A few words, first I recognized from Bronn and the rest I didn""t, followed by a sharp wrap on the shack door. ""Girl, we saw you run in there,"" I sighed with relief.",748687
1842,"Demo has her explosives, chemicals and tools are categorized with OCD neatness and there isn""t a single non-functional thing around. Even the desk and chair are the cheapest things picked out of an Ikea catalogue with no mind for comfort or aesthetics. Behind her desk, Demo adjusts the blindfold that""s covering her eyes. Briefly, a nasty looking stripe of scar tissue is revealed; whatever is under that blindfold is best unseen.

A good demolitions expert is anal, hates fun and has no hobbies. I don""t drink alcohol, smoke or eat meat. I am the best in my particular field and I don""t need eye sight to get my work done."" We not cut to the familiar sight of battle between the two merc teams. Heavy lays down supressing fire and bullets fly in every which direction but this time she gets mowed down by a sniper. The Blue sniper surveys her work from a tower, only for the tower""s foundations to blow and the sniper""s perch to tip over. Demo and Scout step through the dust, a submachinegun in each hand. Back in the interview, Demo holds up the wires she uses in demolitions. ""Each one of my wires is an identical color but has a different texture. As a result, the Blue team never knows which wire to cut when defusing my bombs."" At the battle, Scout lays down shotgun fire while Demo sprays everywhere with her submachine guns; mowing down an enemy engineer and driving back a soldier. Spinning around, she hears footsteps over the gunfire and blows away an approaching spy about to do a backstab. In her office, Demo points to the brass bells on her tactical gear. ""When I move, the bells make sound and that allows me to run at speed in unfamiliar environments. It""s not dissimilar to echolocation. Any human can do it, but it takes practice to use it like I do."" Demo is now running down the central corridor of the Blue base, brass bells chiming over the guns and explosions. She throws down sticky bombs to cover her tracks and slow down her pursuers. At the center of the Blue base, she begins to set up a device with a radioactive symbol on it. The Demowoman scratches under her blindfold. ""Yes, I""ve always been blind. I was born blind; so thankfully when my younger brother gouged out my eyes it wasn""t a big deal."" Demo walks away from the Blue base and casually hits a detonator. The entire blue base blows up, turning into a mushroom cloud that rises up at least a mile into the atmosphere. ""Holy shit!"" shouts a Scout blinded by the explosion""s flash. ""Did you use a nuke!?"" Demo smiles. ""Yes."" Back in the office, Demo gives a big grin. ""I took much worse from my brother than a pair of eyes.""",1220273

1716,"I pulled away, eyes downcast, ""Please, don""t make me something I""m not."" I ran from the King then. He called after me, but I dashed through the halls of Winterfell and away from all the confusion. The conflicting emotions deep in my chest; the happiness of our shared feelings, the warmth of Jon""s kiss... fear as the proposition he""d laid at my feet. Not of marriage, not yet, but of the future assumption of one. How could he want me like that? I had nothing to offer him, except a closer tie to House Lannister through technicality. It""s not as if I was even a Lannister, not truly. All the money, all the things I had that weren""t in that little chest back in the Tower at the Red Keep, were my father""s. There was no possible benefit in taking me as a wife. None whatsoever, yet the look on his face... Jon hadn""t cared. I stopped outside the door to my room, eyes blown wide. Unless I had missed something else? ""No,"" I shook my head and went inside, Florys leaping off the bed immediately to greet me. There was nothing else. Nothing to tempt a man like him for anything other than the role of Paramour. Which I was... fine with. Mother would be furious, even now I could hear her screaming in my head to be careful. To not feel for a man like Jon Targaryen, so strong and so powerful and at the likely cross-hairs of every plot of political intrigue in the country. I was a coward. A yellow-bellied coward. I curled up underneath my sheets and balled my fists in the fabric. I would have to convince him - and likely my Father too - that I wasn""t fit to be Queen. I didn""t want to be Queen. I didn""t want to be in those cross-hairs, I didn""t want to be that target. I didn""t want to end up like my mother. But even then, that night, my traitorous mind would only dream of dragons and thrones. I didn""t leave my room until Bridget came and readied me for supper. Florys trailed close at my side all the way to the dining hall, and I didn""t have the heart to stop the fox. In the large dining hall - smaller than the great hall, for more intimate meals than the arrival banquet - everyone was already seated. At the head, Sansa and Jon, with the Kingsguard and my father down one end of the table and Bran with the rest of the Northerners down the other. There was only one spot empty in the all the table, and I hesitated. It was at the corner next to Jon, where Tyrion usually sat. My father was sitting one more seat down. Tyrion eyed me and smiled before patting the seat. For a moment, I loathed the man, ""Synne, sit. I thought you wouldn""t join us tonight."" I nodded and forced a smile. When I sat, Florys curled up under my skirts. Tyrion eyed the fox - silent, quite well hidden - but didn""t say anything. I couldn""t look at Jon, though I felt his eyes boring into me. So I stared passed him at his sister, ""Lady Stark, are you feeling better? I""m... sorry I didn""t come back after checking on His Majesty and speaking with my Father. I was um... pretty tired after all the exci- I mean, after everything."" Calling an attempted assassination attempt ""excitement"" seemed rather rude.",748687
2141,"She put on a smile for the girl. ""I understand. I will take care of it."" She waved a hand. ""Now back to bed for you, we have a big big big day tomorrow."" The girl seemed reluctant, but left. Effie closed her door and went to put on a proper face. She grumbled to herself about Haymitch""s manners and what a drunk he was, not even able to get to his sleeping car. She had half a mind to wake him up and chew him out. Frightening the children, tributes, was no way for a mentor to act. When she looked presentable, Effie went to the source of the screaming. When she saw Haymitch, her hard face immediately softened. He was thrashing around, looking like a scared boy, fighting for his life. Careful of his bottle, which he was clutching and using like he would a knife, Effie kneeled next to him. Effie Trinket wasn""t the most maternal of people, she was too involved in herself for that, but she ran her fingers through Haymitch""s hair and made some soothing noises until he calmed down into an uneasy, but quiet sleep. She tried to pry his bottle from his hands, but realized the effort would be futile after a few moments. She removed his shoes, put his entire body on the couch and threw a blanket over him. It would become a habit of hers moving forward, taking care of Haymitch when he slept. She always told herself she did it for the children, tributes. Haymitch wasn""t too surprised to wake up on the couch. He was surprised to find that his shoes were off and he had a blanket draped over him. He rarely made such an effort. He never knew who did this, but he always suspected her whenever he woke up. The group had an uneventful breakfast, no one wanting to make conversation. Effie made a few half-hearted attempts, but faded out quickly enough. After she sent the tributes off to prepare for their presentation at the Capitol, she turned to Haymitch. He didn""t like the look in her eyes. She put a medicine bottle in front of him. ""What""s this?"" He asked, already supsecting. ""Sleeping pills. Your screaming woke the tributes last night."" An awkward silence settled between them. ""Do you want to talk about it? I find that sometimes helps when I have bad dreams."" ""It""s none of your damn business."" He threw her pills back at her, grabbing a bottle on his way out. Effie was struggling not to cry out on the platform. She knew she had a job to do, and knew it was imperative that she keep a smile on her face for the cameras, but it hurt when he threw those pills back at her. She was just trying to help. Why wouldn""t he let her? Still, she kept a hand on each tributes shoulder and prayed the blinding cameras didn""t catch any tears. She ignored any hurt feelings, deciding to focus all of her energy on her tributes. She reminded both of them to smile, but neither of them could manage a good one. They looked scared. No one bet on the scared looking children. Frustrated, Effie looked out into the crowd. Most of the people looked bored except one, Plutarch Heavensbee was staring at Haymitch. Despite her feelings, Effie leaned over and poked Haymitch to get his attention.",1497577

596,"Van is somewhere around here, in this vicinity."" Thomas eyed the surrounding terrain. His eye caught a glance of movement in the corner. ""We better leave, now."" Raven watched them carefully; as he made a last minute attempt in spying that the trio had left the area. Although it would have been easier if he just took them down personally, Raven was worried Van might be a bit harsher than him. After all, he clearly remembers them when he had his amnesia. And they seemed nice enough... ""For homosexual werewolves that is...""Raven mused as he looked back at Van, who was hugging his knees, his eyes carefully observing the boulder by the corner. Raven sat close by Van, his hood still covering his face. He was tired all morning, and never expected that they would show up. He had many plans for Van and him this day. Maybe shopping for new clothes (peh, they needed new disguises, didn""t they? ), go sightseeing in town (Hiltz and Ryss appearance started to bored him, and I guess he assumed Van felt the same) and by night, see the stars across the night sky, while lying on the cornfield across town. It was his favorite sanctuary after all... ""Well, well, well. If it isn""t Mr. I-own-this-cute-and-handsome-guy..."" Raven looked back to who it was. It was the rogue pilot (who sported the same hairdo as Raven""s) they met at the inn. Apparently, she brought her sisters along (who also sported the same hairdo, although one was yellow and the other was neon green). ""I never forgot you. Now, you""ll pay for insulting me!"" Pink hair snapped. ""When you insult one..."" Yellow hair continued. ""...You insult us!!!"" Green hair finished. And with a weird, and strangely funny, group pose, the trio shouted. ""The Black Crow Gang!!!"" Raven sweatdropped under his hood, as Van just stared at them like some malignant cancer. ""Amateurs..."" Raven finally spoke. ""Grrr, how dare you taint our ears with your childish rebellion and insolence!"" Pink hair grew a vein on her knuckles. ""Let""s teach him about manners, sisters!"" Pink hair commanded, as the three women brandished leather whips that were earlier strapped on their hips. The women were particularly dangerous-looking already. And it seemed that Raven and Van are gonna experience a whole world of pain... ‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡‡ Yeah!!! I finally got my first review!!!

Raven: It""s ok, just go on with your work. I""ll mind Van for a little while. Raven""s having one of those mood swings, I guess.

2556,"The handler there was a friend of Seighart""s dad and promised to inform them as well if things are found. Tired a bit, Seighart offered they rest and eat for a moment at downtown square, by the number of café""s that lined the plaza. Haru steadily declined, persisting to go to the fisher""s village. ""We can""t go there right now, Haru."" Seighart reasoned with him. ""Why not? The sooner, the better right?"" Haru quirked. ""The bars don""t open until 3am in the morning, it""s when the time fisherman leave for the sea. The following two hours, their wives swarm it, where they wait for their husbands. Then at 6 am, when they""d have come back after fishing, they go drinking there again."" Seighart explained. ""What? So it means we have to go there tomorrow?"" Haru stiffened, worry gaining control over him again. ""C""mon, Haru. You have to eat at least. God knows what would happen to you if you kept at this pace in an empty stomach."" Seighart decided to stop the baby act and forcefully drag the boy with him inside a restaurant. Sighing, Haru allowed himself something to eat. Seighart ordered two slices of pizza and a banana split for each of them. Although Haru really had no intention of eating, he allowed Seighart to prod that slice of pizza and that spoon of ice cream into his open mouth. ""Knock it off, Haru. You act like some kid that needs to be spooned just to eat."" Seighart smiled a bit from Haru""s antics. Haru grinned as he wiped his lips of ice cream and prodded that finger into his mouth, savoring the cream and fudge. Both ate in silence for a few moments. A few people passed by, some few girls giggling at them, and a few men as well. Both didn""t mind them though, Haru thinking about his family""s whereabouts and Seighart thinking of some other matter. Afternoon came, and both took the bus back to their school. Haru reported to the dean of today""s itinerary before going home, and Seighart reporting to Julius and Elie of today""s itinerary before bringing Haru home. ""Wow, so you took all that time today just to find news about Haru""s family and almost three quarters of it was spent eating two slices of pizza and a banana split?"" Julius mouthed out before stopping himself from doing so, the quartet walking towards the bookstore while Gale, unknown to them, was following and listening on cue. Both blushed momentarily before eyeing the other one with knowing eyes. Seighart smiled at Haru, and the other, offering a grin. Gale didn""t miss that look on Haru. The look of Haru""s eyes on Seighart. ""Oh please, will you two knock that talk! You two look like some guys from that yaoi doujinshi I borrowed from Julius!"" Elie playfully punched both men""s shoulders. Julius, in an instant, was on Elie; digging his fists on the girl""s temples, while Elie, stretching Julius face to a wide radius. Haru reddened further more. Seighart only blinked a bit, but noted that blush in Haru""s cheek. Of course, Elie had only meant it a joke between friends but why would Haru blush that much?",583064
1451,"Plus she had the normal high society make up on that made her seem more like an Egyptian. Jamila finally made a dashing leap at Alex only to find herself launching to the ground instead of him, because Alex had made a quick dodge. She turned in time to see his sword coming at her. She rolled to her side and stood up as she swiped her leg to make him lose balance. Alex did lose balance, but regained it quickly as she was bringing her dagger down upon him. He rolled the other way and then jumped up. Jamila came at him and he did a back flip knocking her dagger out of her hand with a kick. Alex landed on his feet in front of her dagger so she couldn""t reach it. Jamila frowned in annoyance, but quickly came up with a plan. She quickly ran at Alex, but jumped in the air and used his shoulder to turn her self in time to land behind him and grab her sword and point it at his throat as he turned and pointed his sword at hers. For a moment they stood there breathing hard and then they burst out into laughter. ""Well done Jamila. You""re progressing,"" Alex said dropping his sword as she did. ""With you as my teacher, why wouldn""t I be,"" Jamila said lowering her sword. ""Because we spend to much time doing this,"" Alex said walking closer to her and taking her lips with his. Jamila smiled into the kiss as she wrapped her arms around his neck and he wrapped his around her waist. Then after a few moments she came to her senses and pulled away. ""We shouldn""t be doing this Amun,"" Jamila said shaking her head. ""Why? It hasn""t stopped us before,"" Amun/Alex said with a crooked smile as Jamila continued to frown. ""Because things have changed. Father has chosen my suitor, he""s announcing my engagement soon,"" Jamila said as tears flowed down past her eyelids. Amun/Alex walked closer to her again to bring her into an embrace, but Jamila backed away. ""We can""t do it anymore Amun. I will not betray myself by doing this,"" Jamila said wiping away her tears. ""But it hurts you, see,"" Amun/Alex said as he finally got close enough to wipe away her tears from her face, ""Sure you can""t do this. I love you to much to lose you Jamila."" ""I know,"" Jamila replied sadly as he finally was able to wrap his arms around her. ""We""ll run away together. We""ll start a family. The medji...your father...they won""t know,"" Amun/Alex (okay from here I""m changing it to Alex but it""s Amun okay people""s) frantically blurted out. ""They""d follow us Amun. I""m a princess, you""re a soldier, we""re not supposed to be together. They can have you killed,"" Jamila wept as she cuddled into his arms. Alex shook his head and said, ""I will not break the rules, but I won""t be breaking them if they thought we were dead."" Jamila""s head snapped up and looked at him, ""Amun! NO! I will not do it. I don""t know the curse as well as Imhotep. Plus who would bring me back? You surely couldn""t do it and Imhotep would refuse."" ""You do not know that. The high priest cares for you Jamila and he""d want the best for you,"" Alex replied. ""He does not think you""re the best for me, and neither does my father.",806976
2435,"I would have wagered anything that she had been the Student Council President in Junior High, like I had. ""How can people tell?"" I wondered. ""It""s like you""re always fated to be selected for these things,"" I joked, though underlying it was a slight dash of frustration. Miyazawa merely smiled and said nothing, and I wondered how this girl, who on the surface was so similar to me, managed to be so different underneath. ""Was Hokuei your first choice, Miyazawa-san?"" I asked. I wanted to know how she had ended up coming here. ""Yes,"" she said simply. ""Why?"" I said, then felt pressed to offer more explanation for my nosiness. ""I mean, aren""t you really intelligent? I""d""ve thought you could have applied to your choice of private schools, or something..."" Her face became tranquil. ""Well, I have two younger siblings... and besides... "" she said, and a smile lit her pretty features, ""I""ve decided not to invest any money in my studies. I want to minimize the financial burden on my parents, and maximize my studies relative to that."" It startled me. I had never really considered her motivations, but she was such a caring daughter and a determined person. If anyone could get the most out of the public school system, it would be Miyazawa. It made me feel guilty for coming to Hokuei -- if I wasn""t there, then Miyazawa would shine, unopposed. The way she deserved to. She didn""t seem to notice my distraction. ""Studying with that in mind hardens my will!"" she informed me cheerfully. ""It""s really interesting to study when you have a goal."" I had never thought of my studies as interesting, merely as something expected of me. ""So mature,"" I whispered. ""Well, I think this because we""re not very wealthy,"" she said, and she was not envious of me, although she had to know that my family owned a hospital. ""If we had money to spare, I would have wanted to go to a private school,"" she confessed, ""since it seems like fun!"" She went on to describe the advantages, before turning the table on me. ""What about Arima-kun?"" she asked. ""Eh?"" I was used to people asking me questions, but usually there was some ulterior motive behind them. Miyazawa was genuinely curious, and I doubted it was because of a romantic interest in me. ""Your parents run a hospital, right? I think it""s strange that someone like you comes to a public school."" Miyazawa was the first one who told me that to my face. Normally someone of my background and abilities would have gone to a prestigious private school. But I have chosen not to. My motives, though, were nowhere near as noble as hers, as I had no clue had to voice them. ""Yeah... me too. I have the same reasons as you, I guess,"" I said. It was the truth, in a way. I didn""t want to be a burden to my family. They had done enough for me. ""I guess we""re both just stingy!"" she declared. Miyazawa started giggling... and then exploded into laughter, a genuine sound that made me join in. Her clear eyes shocked me, and I noticed, for the first time, that the woman who stood beside me had no uncertainties. I wanted that.",1112924
2258,"It happened so fast that she didn""t really have time to think and ask questions until afterward. She had been dancing. The only attire that she wore differently than her fellow ""ladies"" at the Golden Cat were the satin ballet slippers instead of the heeled boots. She also sang to her increasingly drunken guest: ""Love is a distant aroma at best A withering smile that""s stuck deep in your vest At night air it wraps its fingers around Your body it shakes from the now distant sound Of the sound of her voice A sweet symphony Played over and over Until you are free-"" During the next moment, he had seized her and was being extremely rough with her. Normally he""d have been too clumsy by this point to actually hurt her, but when she smelled the whiskey on his breath, her blood had gone cold. This particular regular was always meaner when he had whiskey and he""d had quite a bit before seeking out her company. The bottle of liquor had gotten knocked aside, spilling all over the floor. When Ana resisted, he struck her in the face rather hard. Blood trickled from the corner of her mouth and traced a line across her now deathly-pale skin into her short raven-black hair. Her dark green eyes were reddened with tiredness and now sparkling with tears. She""d done her best to fight him off, but he hit her again and again. She was dangerously close to blacking out when his hands went to her throat. Then, all at once, the pressure was released. The baron was dragged backward into the shadows by an unseen person and she heard him gurgle, gag, and then go still. Heart thundering, she sat up, wide-eyed. The figure stepped out of the shadows and her mouth dropped open in shock. In place of flesh, she saw a grotesque metal mask. Her heart thundered and she only had time to wonder if he meant to kill her or to help her. Then, several guards came stampeding up the stairs. Thinking fast, she grabbed the scarlet blanket off the bed, threw it over him, and shoved him down. She jumped on the bed with him just as the guards came bursting in. She hoped that the baron was out of sight enough that they wouldn""t see him-the drape mostly covered him. The guard in front stopped abruptly, thinking he had walked in on something. Ana was sweating profusely, breathing hard, and the straps of her camisole were sliding down her shoulders. She had just wiped the blood away from her lips clumsily with her hand. Luckily, the light was dim. ""I...uh....beg your pardon,"" the guard said awkwardly, his face reddening, ""but have you seen this man?"" He held up a poster. A strikingly good likeness of the masked man she now hid under the covers was sketched there. ""As a matter of fact, I did see him just now,"" Ana said, ""he went out that window and onto the ledge. If you hurry, you can still catch him."" ""After him!"" the guard barked, sprinting toward the window. Someone had the discretion to close the door. And Ana had to stifle her laughter in her hands. ""Stay here for a moment,"" she hissed to the lump under the covers, ""I""ll go see if they""re gone yet.""",870118
3253,"Even though Harrison knew Sam loved George he couldn""t stop loving her, because even the tiniest thought that Sam could love him back was enough for him to keep loving her. ""Yeah man how is she?"" Harrison turned his glance to George, he shook his head. ""Why does everyone keep asking me that? Do I look like I have the answers to everything?"" Carmen watched Harrison sadly, lately she was always feeling bad for Harrison, it just didn""t seem fair that Harrison would never be able to have the person he loved, it just wasn""t fair, but a lot of things weren""t fair in life. ""Harrison calm down, it""s just that you know Sam better then anyone"" Brooke nodded. Nicole remained quiet. Mary Cherry watched him in awe. Josh lowered his eyes. Sugar Daddy took a bite of his food. ""I used to know Sam better then anyone! Used being the keyword here! I don""t know Sam.... not anymore"" Harrison went to pick up his lunch but just slammed it back down on the cafeteria table making his friends jump back in surprise, Harrison pushed himself up and walked out of the cafeteria bumping into Sam on his way out. ""Hey Harris---"" Sam stopped short of her sentence when she saw the look on Harrison""s face, it was one of anger and sadness and then to make things even more worse Harrison pushed his way past Sam, he didn""t even look back, it was like he had walked right through her, like she didn""t mean a thing to him. ""Here"" Sam shoved her plate of food to April Tuna and took after Harrison. ""Harrison! Harrison!"" Sam pushed her way through the crowd of teenagers who were busily chatting about various things--- things that varied to ramblings about who was better for Joey... Dawson or Pacey to the latest fashion news---- Sam rolled her eyes and continued to push her way through the crowd, she had to catch up with Harrison, she had to find out what was bothering him. Harrison had just pushed right past her, he had never done something like that, was he mad at her? And if so, what about? ""Besides the obvious"" Sam pushed through the last bit of the crowd and rushed out of the school, she let her brown eyes skim every possible inch of the outside area of the school, her eyes stopped when she saw Harrison sitting under a weepy and big oak tree. Sam heaved a heavy sigh, she brushed back the loose strands of her hair that fell in front of her eyes--- she continued to stare at Harrison, she really didn""t know what to do, she had this huge urge in her heart to run over to him and take his body in her arms but she knew that things weren""t that simple anymore, nothing was simple anymore. One confession---- one declaration of love---- changed everything, there was no turning back, Sam couldn""t pretend that Harrison was just her friend---- indeed he was her best friend but he was so much more to her... he was her steady brick wall that helped her be strong when she felt she was weak... he was the shoulder she leaned on... he was her eyes when she was blind... he was her wings that made her fly... could he be *that* to her too? Sam sighed once more and shuffled her way over to Harrison.",29783
294,"""He-llo, Mr. Fancy!"" Lily exclaimed when she opened the door. ""Right out of GQ."" ""Ha, ha,"" Josh rolled his eyes. GQ- ugh. ""Yeah, so my mom wants you to be in our family picture. Can you come over real quick?"" ""But I""m not a Shannon..."" Josh laughed. ""Are you kidding? You""ve known me and my family since you were born and you practically live at my house. As far as we""re concerned, you""re a Shannon."" Lily digested this thought. ""Okay... so, my name has now changed to Lily Gillan-Shannon."" She paused. ""Ugh, sounds like I got married to one of you. Let me go change, I""ll be out in five."" She darted back into the house, not bothering to close the door. Josh followed her inside, knowing she wouldn""t care either way. He""d always liked the Gillan""s house- it always smelled like flowers, and since Lily was an only child, the atmosphere was actually quite peaceful. Pictures were dotted along the house here and there. They were mostly photos of the Gillans over the years. Josh looked at them for what felt like the hundredth time, and, as always, compared the one with a male member to the one without. His smile faded- that year, when Lily was five, her father had passed away. Lily didn""t remember much, and nor did he. When they were growing up, Lily often called Jim ""Uncle Dad"" for this reason. And then there were some miscellaneous pictures that sat on tabletops here and there. Some of them were from Lily""s photography classes, while some were ordinary shots of them making stupid faces. Sigh. Those were the good old days. ""Okay, let""s gooo!"" Lily declared, marching from her room. Her dress was a simple flowery prairie dress, but its effect was good. She grabbed his arm and they flew back to the Shannon house. ""There you are!"" Jim said, obviously relieved. ""My lovely wife as almost to the brink of killing us all,"" he joked loudly so Elisabeth could hear. ""Yes! I had the knife ready and everything!"" Elisabeth shouted back from the bathroom. Jim chuckled. ""Well, she decided on a few inside and a few outside and then we""ll be done."" A ""few inside and a few outside"" didn""t come nearly as close to what Elisabeth actually had in mind. She did a whole family shot inside, then pictures of everyone individually, and then the children together, and finally Jim and Elisabeth themselves. And then the entire process was repeated outside. ""Oh, my God,"" Lily moaned when she walked back to her house. ""Josh, I appreciate the thought and everything, but next time, don""t tell me when your family is taking next year""s pictures. I think I lost the ability to smile."" Sigh. This kind of thing happens every year at my house when my mom just declares that we must take Christmas pictures. Reviews are love! :) XX. AHHHH! I just got back from a Taylor Swift concert, and she just ROCKED MY SOCKS OFF! Bad news, though: I have now lost the ability to speak. D: STALKER CHICK ALERT!

925,"One of the many things Emma doesn""t want to admit to herself is that Henry is exactly the kind of boy she would have hated to be around growing up. It doesn""t take any time at all to purchase the tickets, soda and popcorn from the lone vendor. Henry still isn""t back, so she looks around the lobby for lack of anything better to do. The framed movie posters advertising the future releases from the studios are all for mainstream stuff, and she there""s nothing forthcoming she wants to see. When Emma watches movies, she prefers cynical art house stuff, since mainstream Hollywood just infuriates her. Life is not tied up in neat little packages with pretty ribbons inside two hours. ""Which film are you seeing today?"" a voice asks from one side, and she nearly jumps out of her skin as she spins around. Someone has come up behind her, and she could have sworn there was no one there a minute ago. She knows who it has to be. Mr. Gold is always lurking to the side, just out of focus. He oozes into the room, just like carbon monoxide. He""s suddenly there, no one sees him coming, and he""s deadly. Emma forces her face to remain calm as she confronts the worst boogeyman in the town. Regina pisses her off, but Mr. Gold is the one who scares her. She""s been around rough characters most of her life, and she""s learned when it""s best not to mess with someone. Mr. Gold sets off every one of her internal alarms, although she""s not able to pinpoint why. He""s a jackass involved in human trafficking, but she""s encountered many of those jackasses. The one reason she can pin down is that Mr. Gold does not lie, ever. He""s mastered the ability to be selective with the truth, and that makes him one of the most dangerous men Emma""s ever met. ""I""m sorry if I startled you,"" he apologizes genteelly. ""It""s fine,"" she lies. ""What are you doing here?"" ""I own this place,"" Mr. Gold tells her. It""s only her promise to Henry to watch The Muppets with him that keeps her from turning around and marching right out. She shouldn""t be surprised - Granny told her Mr. Gold owned the entire town. Emma doesn""t want to be in this conversation any longer than she has to be, so she goes for the direct route. ""Is there some reason you""re talking to me?"" ""There""s always a reason, Ms. Swan,"" he replies, and she still can""t pinpoint the origins of his accent, a little thing which bugs the heck out of her. She thinks it""s Scottish, but it""s not quite right. ""Today, I""m simply making polite conversation with one of my business partners."" There is nothing simple about him. He may be dapper, but she knows that under all his civility, he""s the craziest son of a bitch she""s ever encountered. She owes the bastard a favor, and she""s not likely to forget that anytime soon. He""s going to make sure of that. ""I see."" She pauses, struggling for a way to get out of this conversation without doing irrevocable damage to her position with him. ""My movie""s about to start, so I need to go get seats."" ""I don""t think any of the matinees are going to sell out today,"" he assures her. ""Plenty of seating.""",1112924
102,"So here I am, sitting alone outside the front gates of Balamb Garden, my chin tucked in my knees. Chris was sparring with Sarah""s bother Leon while Sarah herself was on stand-by with a med kit. Those two had a tendency to get a little out of hand when sparring. I didn""t like the large halls of Garden or the training grounds so I came out here. There is a little flower garden outside the gates; carnations and roses of many colors blooming in a small, wild patch. The groundskeeper had yet to discover it; when he does, it will be torn down. It made me sad, thinking of such a pretty little arrangement of flowers, hidden from sight, being torn apart just because it didn""t look at clean and cut out as the rest of the Garden. ""What are you doing over here all alone?"" Came a familiar voice from behind me. I jumped like a little child just caught with their hand in the cookie jar. Heat rushed to my face as I swung around to see a tall many in front of me. He wore black pants and white tank-top with a black vest over it. His arms were covered with black fishnets, both his wrists had white wristbands. The man""s hair was a dark, dark brown and his eyes of a similar shade, but lighter and welcoming. He had the look of someone untamed, wild, yet still handsome and serious. It wasn""t until I saw the necklace around his neck did I know who it was. Hanging from a silver chain was an intricate silver pendant bearing a roaring lion. I was speechless, shocked at being caught by the leader of the SeeD, ""..."" ""What, shy?"" A small smile broke out across his features. He walked over beside me and sat down before I could stop him, ""How about I keep you company. What""s your name? Mine""s Mitsuru Leonhart."" Of course I knew who he was, though I had only ever seen him in uniform and from far away. A Leonhart was always the leader of the SeeD; ever since Sorceress Ultimecia""s downfall. Technically it is whomever is appointed by the headmaster to be leader, but as of yet the chain has never been broken. Not for hundreds of years. ""... I... I""m..."" I looked down at my hands, my face still red from being caught; I should actually be training with the others right now, ""Seraphim... Seraphim Kramer."" ""Ahh, I see..."" Mitsuru chuckled slightly, shaking his head, ""So you""re Headmaster Alphonse""s granddaughter. He told me you""d graduated; never told me you were such a cute little thing. How long have you been going here?"" My face flushed even darker at being called ""cute"". Leon was the only one who has ever called me that; and he doesn""t really count, being a... player... and all, ""S-since I was little..."" ""Really? Hmm..."" Mitsuru""s eyebrows pulled together, ""I wonder why I""ve never run into you before. Anyway, you should hear the Headmaster go on about you, Sera!"" That threw me off. My grandfather is so cold to me... he doesn""t like me at all. In fact, I""ve always thought he hated me because he didn""t like mom. And that name, Sera... only Heather, my best friend, had ever called me Sera. Did he know her? ""My... my grandfather? He... doesn""t like me though.""",748687

Raven""s tongue deftly gave Van a reason to hold the boy closer to him, pleading on to suck harder. But Raven finally stopped. Van lost all control and strength and fell back to the floor of the rooftop, bringing him and Raven to make a bit of an ""oof"" sound. But Raven still had strength, and straddled Flyheight on his abdomen. ""Happy, Van?"" Raven asked him, smirking. ""Small tease..."" Van grinned, huffing and puffing at the action he received. And Raven took hold of Van""s side as he straddled lower into Van""s bulging member, and let his ass grind itself into Van""s bulging member. Van arched up and began to curse softly, skeptical if Raven did have amnesia. This boy is damn too hot for someone who lost his memory! But he got lost in thought again as Raven grinded his own bulging member against Van""s, laying himself down on Van. ""Ohgodohgodohgod"" Van inanely repeated as Raven began to move faster and faster. Taking hold of Raven""s ass, he pushed Raven""s hips more and more against him, making Raven yelp at the deeper contact. Van could have cummed any minute... And then there was silence. Van looked up to see Raven fall asleep on him again, laying his head on to his chest. ""Good night...Raven...""Van whispered and carried him slowly back to his room, unmindful of the malicious stares of the staff and the glaring of his friends.

Now, I could argue this fact with her, but I know better. As Koizumi mentions all the time, she has to always be content for the world to be in order. I""ve seen what happens when she""s not content. Closed spaces start to appear, and the less happy she gets, the bigger they grow. So, we have to tailor to her every need. It""s either that, or Ragnarock for the world. It""s scary that I""m not joking about something like this. It is a very harsh reality. And so, I remain silent, waiting for a few minutes, knowing that there is nothing of the strange variety that can be found in my closet. After a few more minutes of searching, Haruhi seems to finally give up, turning around to look directly at me, her hands at her hips. ""Well, I can""t find anything worthwhile around here! Your house is too normal, Kyon!"" Haruhi barked at me, and I merely rolled my eyes. Haruhi looks from side to side for a few seconds, like she""s looking for something. Suddenly, she gets right up in my face, causing me to almost step back because of how close to me she suddenly is. ""So what now, Kyon?"" she asks me, and for once, I really didn""t have much of a response. The question is obviously alluding to the fact that Haruhi wants to be entertained in some way. The problem is, I couldn""t think of anything. You know, I can think of so many things Taniguchi could say about this particular situation. To him, the fact I""m alone with this beautiful and eccentric girl in my own bedroom, well.... I mean, forgetting that again... ""Well...there""s not much to do. And I""m kind of tired so..."" ""Ok, Kyon. You have a point. Even the Brigade Chief needs some rest after doing so much work for the day!"" She replies, smiling in my face as I merely groan quietly. The fact she thinks that her job as Brigade Chief is so hard doesn""t surprise me at all. But then again, not much surprises me when it comes to Haruhi. ""Now get out, Kyon! I have to get changed for bed!"" Haruhi yells at me, her facial expression shifting in a flash. Before I could even react, I find that I was being thrown out of my own room. I can feel myself tumbling on the carpet in the hallway, and before I can even pick my head up, my door has already closed shut behind me. I sigh as always, brushing myself off as I stand up. I""ve yet to understand Haruhi Suzumiya completely.",967934
3124,"""But she doesn""t know where we are, right?"" I mean if we keep quiet..."" ""She can sense me. I""m a child of Athena, she can sense all of us."" Percy ran. Any thoughts of how tired his legs were flew out of his mind. He thought he could hear a scratching following them, like a spider running along a metal wall. It might""ve been his imagination. He hoped it was his imagination. The sound kept getting closer, growing with every step he took. Finally, when he thought his lungs would burst, he saw something in the ground in front of him. As they neared it, he saw it was a hole in the floor. A faint glow of light was coming out of it. Hoping that that meant it lead to something, the second he could, Percy leapt into it. He hit something hard and stumbled, but managed to keep his balance. Throwing a quick glance around, he saw that they were it a tunnel of some sort. Torches lined the walls. The sudden brightness hurt his eyes, but he refused to close them. Gently putting Annabeth down so her back was propped up against the wall, he turned and squinted up back through the hole that he had jumped through. To his relief, it was quite small. Not nearly large enough for a giant spider to slip through. Still, not seconds later, two huge, hair legs came down and started feeling around desperately, like a cat for a mouse. Percy uncapped riptide and in a smooth motion, chopped them both off. Arachne screamed above them. (At least Percy thought it was a scream) And she withdrew the stumps of legs. ""Daughter of Athena,"" she hissed, causing Percy to move protectively in front of Annabeth even though he knew she couldn""t possibly reach them. ""I will find you! And when I do, I shall have my revenge!"" There was the scratching sound again, and then nothing. Percy sighed and capped riptide. ""Are you alright?"" he asked, turning towards Annabeth. ""I""m fine."" Her face was chalk white, but other than that Percy couldn""t see anything wrong with her. Well, that hadn""t already been injured, that is. ""Are you sure? Be-"" he started, but she cut him off. ""I""m fine Percy. Really, I""m not trying to be brave or anything. What about you?"" He started to laugh, though he couldn""t say why. Something about her angry expression coupled with their current situation was somehow hilarious to him. She stared at him like he was crazy, then rolled her eyes. ""Come on Seaweed Brain. We need to keep moving. A/N So I might have lied a little about the lengths of my chapters... but this one isn""t too shabby. It""s pretty good for my third straight chapter in three days... I was planning on making it longer but it just seemed like the logical place to end a chapter. Also sorry that nothing really happened. I promise the pace will start to pick up soon Oh, and about the bronze wall thing... I know I said I wouldn""t reuse anything, but that""s actually how Tartarus is described, so it couldn""t be helped. Anyway, thank you to all the lovely reviewers. (And to any future reviewers hint hint) I promise (for real this time) that my next chapters will be longer.",2943978
2134,"When he turned to face Catwoman she was smiling like the cat that caught the canary. He really didn""t like that look. ""I""m taking you in."" ""Are you really?"" He surprised her by attacking. Though Catwoman wasn""t really the type to harm children, she fought him back. It wasn""t much of a fight. Boys Robin""s age were only meant to see women like Catwoman from afar. And even though Catwoman escaped with no trouble, she didn""t like it. Not only did she not claim her painting, but Batman had found a loophole in controlling his reactions to her flirtations. He now had a tag-along buzz kill. Selina couldn""t sleep, unlike Bruce who""d collapsed almost immediately after finishing. They were at his place, which was rare, and she looked at him against his expensive sheets. Though Bruce almost never looked completely relaxed, he at least looked somewhat peaceful in sleep. She smiled softly, before catching herself. She wouldn""t fall for him and was already dangerously close to liking him too much. She turned to stare upwards, thinking of the delicious leftovers that must be in the refrigerator. Bruce and she had eaten at the newest hotspot in Gotham, but Alfred still must have something in the fridge. She carefully slipped out of the bed, grabbing Bruce""s white dress shirt to cover herself. As she walked down the hall, she buttoned a few buttons. She had nothing to be ashamed of, but on the off-chance Alfred was about, she didn""t want to embarrass him. She found little in the fridge, but found a delicious-looking chocolate creation in the freezer. She licked her lips as she took it out a piece and poured herself a glass of milk. She ate and then rinsed and placed the now empty dishes in the sink. Before going back to bed she penned a cute note to Alfred, thanking him for the treat and asking him to marry her once again. She smiled as she made her way back to the master bedroom, mind elsewhere when she heard, ""Bruce?"" She jumped in a way that wasn""t like her and whirled around to see what had made the sound. She saw a sleepy young boy, with rumpled black hair, who almost looked like he could be Bruce""s son. She pulled together the suddenly too short shirt. ""Who are you?"" His eyes widened as if he was just noticing the beautiful, half-naked woman in the hall. He hadn""t even gotten around to blushing as he answered, ""I""m Dick Grayson."" Selina mentally scrolled through the names of rich Gotham kids, but came up with nothing. It was unlikely the kid was here as a favor. But then why? ""What are you doing here?"" ""I live here,"" he said as it was the most obvious answer in the world. ""Who are you and what are you doing here?"" Selina smiled and tentatively extended a hand, still nervous of the lack of fabric covering her body, ""I""m Selina Kyle. I""m a friend of Bruce""s."" Dick raised an eyebrow. ""A sleepover friend?"" Selina smiled again, unsure of how much a kid Dick""s age would know about sleepover friends. ""You could say that."" Dick still looked bothered about something but nodded his head. ""Oh. Okay."" He went back into the room he""d come out of.",1497577
1880,"Cyril punched one guy out but he never saw the guy behind O""Reily; the guy had grabbed a wooden chair and went to hit O""Reily over the head with it but missed and hit Cyril over the head instead, Cyril fell over and hit his head on the edge of the table, causing blood to pour out of his head.

The doctor was startled by the raising of O""Reily""s voice but then continued. ""There was damage to his brain---"" ""What the fuck does that mean?"" ""He""s brain damaged. He will have the brain of a 5 year old for the rest of his life, you can go see him now if you want"" With that the doctor walked off.

""All my fault. God Cyril, I""m sorry. I love you bro"" O""Reily staggered back and ran out of the hospital, despite Shannon""s screams.

3126,"Barely fifteen minutes later, they came out in a room. Like the first one, it was large, much larger than the passage way, but it was also lit. In the eerie glow of the torches swept along the walls, and Percy saw that they were in some kind of dungeon. Cells with rusty iron bars lined the walls. They went down farther than Percy could see. Cautiously, he leaned forward in order to look into the nearest one. To his relief it was empty. Looking around, he realized that all of the cells were empty, at least all the ones he could see. He tested the bars and saw that they were so rusted that they broke easily. This must have been some old abandoned part of Tartarus. Did Tartarus have abandoned parts? Percy had no idea. With all the monsters that had been on the lose for the past couple of months, it seemed possible... He screwed his head around to look at Annabeth. She shrugged her shoulders as well as she could while hanging on to Percy to show she didn""t know what was up with the empty cells and more than he did. ""Well this seems like a place as good any to sleep,"" he said. Annabeth nodded. Percy went into the nearest cell and put Annabeth down, hoping that if anything attacked them the bars could serve as some sort of protection. ""Are you good?"" He asked. She nodded again, and rested her head against his shoulder breathing heavily. Noticing her I""m-in-pain-but-I""m-too-strong-and-proud-to-admit-it look, Percy fished out the bag of Ambrosia. Giving her another dose this soon could be dangerous, but enough time had probably passed, and if her expression was anything to go by, she needed it. ""Here,"" he said, breaking off a small corner of the divine food and handing it to her. ""Thanks."" She ate it quickly. Looking at the ambrosia in his hand, Percy felt his stomach growl and he remembered that he hadn""t eaten anything since they""d fallen into Tartarus. Picking up a square, he looked it over, drool practically falling out of his mouth as the smell of freshly baked cookies wafted to him. ""Hey, Annabeth, do you know if this stuff can be substituted at real food?"" he asked. She frowned, looking at it. ""I don""t know. I""ve never had any need for it before now. But, now that I think about it, I""m not hungry. Logically, it should heal an empty stomach just like a wound. Try it in super small portions, just to be safe."" Percy anxiously nibbled the edge. Instantly, the taste of warm cookies exploded in his mouth. He swallowed, and at first nothing happened, but finally he started to feel something in his stomach. Slowly but surely the gripping pain of hunger was leaving. He smiled wide. ""Did it work?"" Annabeth asked, but his smile already told her the answer. ""Now, water."" ""That""s easy,"" Percy stated closing his eyes. It took some effort, but he finally located a small puddle of water about twenty feet away from them. Concentrating even harder, he brought it over to them. It was tougher than it should""ve been though, like something was smothering his power. ""Here,"" Percy said, cupping his hands and mentally pouring the water into them.",2943978
3373,"She moaned his name when the blade carved deeper into her skin. He chuckled, removing the blade, he threw it to the side and bringing his mouth to lick up the blood dripping down her wrist. When it was gone, but kept profusely running from the fresh wound, he licked his lips looking up at her. ""Yes. I""ll do it."" She only said yes, because she wanted to help him. She had shot someone before so that wouldn""t be hard, but keeping his attention would, staying alive would deem difficult. ""Perfect. Now go get dressed in something you think I""ll like and bandage up that wrist."" She stood and left the living room doing as he instructed, she didn""t really have anything he""d be interested in. She bandaged up her wrist, going though her closet afterwards, she found something. It was originally something her friend got for her so she could show off to her boyfriend. It was pretty much stripper wear, but it was her favorite colors red and black. A bright red ballerina like skirt that was poofy at the ends. Long fishnet black stockings that went down into leather boot heels that zipped up to below her knees. Black Lace went down the sleeves from the red sports bra that fit very tight to her breasts and showed off her flat stomach. Fingerless black gloves, she put her hair up into pony tails and to appease the Joker. She put white makeup on her face, black around the eyes to make it like a mask, and beat red lipstick. She stepped over to the door and exited the room taking a deep breath and hoping he would enjoy it. When she exited, his back was to her, he was wearing his coat again and scavenging through the fridge. She made a fake cough, placing her hands on her hips and smiling brightly in his direction. He turns to her, freezing he dropped the plate he had held in his hands, it fell to the ground breaking into pieces. She smirked since he wasn""t particularly a man to surprise easily. She leaned into the wall of the hallway and seductively winked at him. ""Fuck me..."" He said under his breath, stepping slowly over to her, looking her up and down. ""Look at you."" He growled lowly, arousal in his tone, lust in his eyes. ""When I told you to get ready I wasn""t expecting this. No wonder you took so long."" ""You told me something you liked. Do you like it?"" He was silent still looking her up and down as if she was a gift because to him she possibly was. ""I guess I will go put something-"" ""No."" He ground out in a sniveling manner as if he was a mad dog. His hands went up her hips and glided down her breasts. ""Oh yes... I love it. Remind me to fuck you in it when we are done working."" She turned beat red, slapping him playfully on the cheek. She didn""t expect that would turn him on more. ""Keep that up and I might not be able to wait."" He wove his fingers in through hers and tugged her to the door. ""Now come. Let""s go catch ourselves a Bat."" This Preview has been turned into a fiction works by the same name shown below and it is highly suggested you read this preview before starting it.",6234395
3419,"""Vaas, I am back man."" Benny stated, Vaas stood up with a pleasant smirk, shoving the women off him as he did. ""That""s fucking great Hermano, how did it go?"" He placed a hand on Benny""s shoulder and for a moment waited for Benny""s reply. He hounded over Benny a whopping four inches, this made Lunetta want to run even more. Height was always a major factor when it came to dominance and leadership, Benny was just about taller than Lunetta, but Vaas seemed to be a lot taller than him. ""It went good. Listen I uh-"" Vaas""s eyes snapped to the woman alongside Benny, Lunetta. He stared for a long minute, taking in her curves, her features, the ample breasts, and dirty skin. He would be lying if he said she wasn""t attractive, she just needed to be cleaned and Vaas being the man he was immediately assumed she was a gift from Benny. He stepped past Benny, who said nothing as Vaas stood in front of her. She stared him directly in the eyes with no regret, but he could see the pain that roamed within the crystal orbs. ""And who is this?"" He asked questionably, grabbing her hand and lifting it to bring her knuckles to his dry lips. She yanked her hand away, stepping back with discomfort as Vaas glared venomously at her. ""I like her already, Benny. Thank you."" ""I""m not a present."" ""Well, if you were, I definitely wouldn""t mind unwrapping you."" She scowled at him in complete disgust, her eyes still traveling the length of his body, inspecting him. ""She is here for business, Vaas."" Vaas spun to look at Benny, pointing his finger at him thoughtfully. ""What business? Hoyt give her to you?"" ""No-"" Lunetta was on the teetering point between beating the crap out of Vaas or Benny. She certainly was going for the latter, honestly she wasn""t a child, she could fend for herself. ""I want to be a pirate."" Not even a second passed before she felt Vaas""s cold calculating gaze upon her, his boots stomping towards her, he looked down at her as something less than a woman or perhaps less than even a human being. ""You listen well chica, I don""t play games unless I initiate them myself. This isn""t a game, I make the rules around here. You are a weak ass bitch, what makes you think I would allow you to be a pirate?"" Lunetta shrugged. ""Fine, if you don""t want me then you won""t have me."" She turned her back to him, nearly out of his arm""s reach before he grabbed her forearm with a tight grip and tugged her into his body. ""I never said I didn""t want you, I said you don""t have what it takes."" He grumbled seductively into her ear. ""I take that as a challenge."" She whispered back into his, some odd sensation rolling through her that shoved away the irritation she had for this man. She would not let this man affect her, she lets no man affect her in such a way and no man ever has. ""Try to prove me wrong and your head will end up on a stake."" ""I don""t care if I die."" His eyes narrowed although they were not looking at one another, he certainly could hear the distaste in that sentence. He was personally intrigued, but out of stubbornness, not willing to admit it.",6234395
3014,"Rei heaved a sigh, finally able to sit down after a long time. There was one thing he learned, Akai Mizuno is a dangerous person to deal with. ""Rei? Who was that on the phone?"" Yuuya came shuffling down from the staircase, mildly interested. ""Ah, no one in particular."" Rei placed the receiver down. ""Yuuya..."" ""...We""re going to downtown to meet someone tonight. I need you to accompany me..."" Rei stood outside of their house, waiting for Yuuya to finish dressing up. He fusses over what he wears more than a girl... Rei thought, hearing Yuuya""s hurried steps on the staircase. ""Uh..."" Rei""s eyes widened when he saw Yuuya. He had never dreamed he""d see this day. Yuuya just grinned stupidly; blushing mildly at the attention Rei was unmindfully giving him. ""So, what do you think? This was one of those clothes you bought for me..."" Yuuya turned round and round, a bit smug and proud on how he looked. ""You...you look..."" Rei unbelievably stuttered, his eyes roaming Yuuya""s figure. Yuuya wore a dark turtleneck sweater (tight-fitting mind you!) that was accented by the snowflake pendant he wore for the first time. A tight pair of leather pants rode low on Yuuya""s hips had not the sweater reached down to it. Yuuya had chosen to complete the attire with a pair of steel-toed boots. ""Oh please...oh please...don""t tell me, Rei!"" Yuuya fussed over his suit. ""Huh? Tell you what?"" Rei slid his hands to his lips, covering the amusement he was experiencing. ""That it kind of looks sluttish..."" Yuuya did a sexy pose, reflecting lust. Knock! ""Whatever gave you the idea...let""s go..."" Rei walked off, Yuuya crouching low recovering from a lump Rei gave him on his head. Both reached the bus stop, Yuuya sticking close to Rei (per Rei""s orders). Yuuya looked dangerous tonight, not for others but for himself. After alighting from the bus ride (full of catcalls and whistles obviously directed to Yuuya), they slowly walked to the venue where Rei would meet the mysterious person Akai sent. ""EEEH! Look at Yuuya""s new outfit! He looks so sexy!"" A girl suddenly shouted. The whole female population from different stalls and shops came out to take a look, and confirming it (obviously with more shouts and swooning), suddenly ran towards them to take a picture of the very daring Yuuya. Rei, feeling trouble, took Yuuya""s hand and ran from the mob, losing them inside a still-open mall. While the whole population where distracted by searching, the two guys slid out of the backdoor and into the street, leading to the fountain. ""Wow...I never thought people would react that way to my clothes..."" Yuuya fussed on himself, noting each part of his slim body. Rei stole glances while Yuuya was busy with himself. I wouldn""t blame them Yuuya...just look at your shoulder...your chest...your torso...hips...legs...those boots of yours...your pert ass. I could just throw you into a dark alley and... Rei suddenly slapped the side of his head...continuously. Yuuya just looked at him curiously before turning his attention back to himself.",583064
3490,"Not even on my birthday will he stay near me... Garu dashed to the sewage pipes and retrieved his present, reflecting on how the day had been a rollercoaster with more downs than ups. Up-he had kept his surprise from Pucca. Down-he""d hurt her feelings and incurred the wrath of Ching and Kim. Up-he had gotten rid of Tobey. Down-Pucca""s first party dress had been ruined. Down-she""d reunited with an old guy friend who had all the girls, even Ching who was stubbornly loyal to Abyo, wagging their tongues with glee. Down-he was most likely going to lose Pucca to that old guy friend. Down-his knowledge of Pucca seemed inferior to that same old guy friend""s knowledge, even though they hadn""t seen each other in years. Down-he had once again incurred Kim and Ching""s wrath. Yeah, the day was far from spectacular for the ninja. He just hoped his present would make up for it all. When he arrived back at the Goh-Rong, everything was quiet. When he peered inside, he saw why. That old guy friend of Pucca""s was serenading her in Korean! And he was amazing. Even Garu had to admit he was good. And Pucca was staring moon-eyed at the guy, something close to adoration shining in her eyes. Pucca clapped wildly along with her assembled friends when Xavier finished his song. He had sung to her one of her favorite songs by Taeyang, her favorite Korean singer. ""I""ll be There"" never sounded so beautiful... ""Have a terrific birthday, P."" Xavier smiled. He then relinquished the mike to Ho. ""That was spectacular! Now, for the rest of the presents."" Ho declared. A precession of gifts came then. : Ring-Ring gave her a platinum-framed picture of her (Ring-Ring""s) debut CD album cover, autographed. Ching gave her a set of ninja stars. Chang gave her a ninja sword. Abyo gave her a jumpsuit ""perfect for ripping off"". Master Su gave her three free hall passes good until she graduated. The Vagabonds gave her a head band. Dada gave her a vibrating pillow for the long rides on the bus. Santa gave her a magic sack full of peppermint candy that would give her some whenever she wanted. Destiny gave her a new bass guitar. And so on. Heck even Doga had given her something (cursed bracelets that made whoever wore them have extremely strong hands and crush whatever they touched). Then Garu gave her his present. It was a silver imprint of her face. She gasped and beamed. ""Thanks, Garu."" She leaped and hugged him. He groaned and extracted himself from her arms. ""Not again..."" he frowned down at her, though his words didn""t carry as much annoyance as before. Pucca beamed all the same. Now she had her best guy friend back and Garu was back to acting politely divided from her. The world was great again. Pucca went to bed on top of the world.

1537,"I didn""t dare to go anywhere without having my cell phone ready for fear I might miss her call. Heck, I even took it with me to the bathroom. When I went out in the afternoon, I avoided the subway because I wasn""t sure if I""d get a call connected from underground. But Yves didn""t call. When it was closing in on 4 pm, I couldn""t stand it any longer. Although I felt a little uneasy when I took the phone and dialed her number, I just couldn""t wait any longer. I had reached a point at which I just wanted to get things straight. I wanted a clear answer. No maybes, no probablys, no ifs, no buts. Just a plain, simple yes or no. While I was waiting for the call to be connected, I remembered our telephone conversation from yesterday. Was there anything I could conclude from her reactions? But all I remembered was that she had seemed to be really delighted to hear from me, and that she was reluctant to meet me. But on the other hand I didn""t think she had lied to me. Knowing Yves, I was sure she had a lot to do. Maybe she really just didn""t have time for me. Yves answered the phone on the fifth ring. ""Hello?"" ""It""s me again, Jimmy."" ""Jimmy! Oh! Hi!"" Yves sounded a little distracted, and I heard a door closing in the background. ""You having a guest over there?"" I asked. ""Is my timing bad?"" ""No,"" Yves said. ""I mean, well, it""s not the best of moments for you to call; I""m halfway through a meeting with a client, but we were about to take a break, anyway."" ""Well,"" I said, ""I thought you were leaving town today?"" ""Yes, I am,"" said Yves. ""In about an hour. I""m sorry, Jimmy, I know I said I""d call you. I always promise to call and then I don""t. Sorry for that."" ""Nevermind,"" I said. ""That""s why I called you now."" My goodness, I thought, now how clumsy does that sound? Like a fifteen-year-old trying to ask his crush out on a first date! ""So..."" Yves drawled. ""So I just wanted to ask you if you""ve changed your mind about that meeting,"" I said. Yves sighed. ""I""m sorry, but it""s not gonna work, Jimmy. I gotta leave in less than an hour. But I told you already yesterday that I probably won""t have the time."" ""Well,"" I said, trying not to let my disappointment show. ""That""s a pity. I""d really have loved to see you again."" I almost added, ""Because I miss you,"" but I swallowed that down. ""Hey, I""m sure the time will come when we""re at the same time in the same city again,"" said Yves bracingly. ""Yeah, ""course,"" I agreed. ""I was just thinking... I can hardly remember the way you are when you""re normal; last time you were so drunk..."" ""Well, now I""m normal,"" she said and laughed. ""Oh, great,"" I said, and laughed as well. ""Alright,"" Yves said. ""Sorry I""m in such a hurry, but my client""s coming back now. I""m sure we""ll meet again, Jimmy."" I decided to take a brave step forward. ""But, Yves... you""re not avoiding me, are you?"" ""No, of course not!"" It almost sounded honest, and maybe it was, but I thought I could hear an ever so slight hesitation in her voice. ""Good,"" I said. ""There wouldn""t be a reason, you know."" ""Sure,"" she said, and this time she definitely sounded honest.",240213
163,"DON""T YOU FEEL SORRY FOR YUTA?!"" Mito suddenly shrieked. She can""t accept that her friends were happy that Yuta is a gay! ""Erm... you""re right! WE ARE VERY ANGRY!"" Their expression gradually changed from amusement to hate. Mito turned to Maya, her eyes blazing with hate. ""WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY BROTHER?!!"" She COULD kill Maya. ""Nothing really. I just placed some drops of a potion delivered to me yesterday on the cookie- accidentally, that is,"" Maya replied with pure amusement. ""But where is the antidote,"" Mikami-sensei asked. Actually, he enjoyed having gay-type Yuta but well, if Mito would know then he""d be dead meat. ""I don""t have it,"" Maya simply replied. ""Give me the potion and I""ll make the antidote!"" Mito commanded after looking at her poor brother.Maya sighed and took out a bottle. The label read: ""Jusenkyo Potion (1), one drop is all you need and you""ll be a totally different person!' She looked at the bottle and threw it to Mito. Mito caught it and her eyes widened. ""This is empty! How could I make the antidote?!"" Mito wailed. She threw the bottle and Nina caught it. Will her brother stay a gay forever? She couldn""t stand it! She has a brother- not a ""sister""! ""Then don""t make any,"" Maya replied with a tone of pure amusement and suppressed excitement.Nina examined the bottle of the potion. ""Hmm...

Nina scolded. ""Sorry,"" Tsujiai apologized. ""Anyway, this is familiar..."" Nina handed him the bottle. ""Could it be that..."" Their eyes widened as realization dawned into them. They nodded and exited the room. ""Don""t you think you""re overreacting, Orihara? I mean, he didn""t kill your chameleon so why do you have to do this to him?!"" Kaji said, his anger boiling inside him. He just realized that the reason Maya had to do this to poor Yuta is unreasonable! It""s unfair!Maya cocked an eyebrow. ""He didn""t kill Chiru physically but he was the first person, save Sebastian,"" she looked at Sebastian who flinched, ""who made fun of my Lulu, thus degrading her morale! """"But still it is unreasonable! You""re so EVIL!"" the prince said. ""I""ll take that as a compliment,"" Maya answered, her tone carrying no emotion at all.""Really! Girls like you will never get married- your personality will scare suitors off! Gosh, that""s why you will be an old hag!"" Rio muttered to himself. Of course, he was sorry for Yuta but, well, he thought that it was a good punishment for all his misdoings. ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"" Yuta suddenly shrieked. They all turned to him.Nina was pouring hot water from a teakettle at the top of his head, thus soaking him.""Hmm... it seems hot water doesn""t work,"" Tsujiai mused loudly. ""What are you two doing?"" Mikami-sensei asked, he looked from Nina to Tsujiai.""Well... we thought that hot water would work like that in Ranma 1/2,"" Tsujiai answered. Nina nodded in agreement. ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ALL?! My beautiful gown is already ruined! It""s all your fault!""",560480
2555,"Maybe they""d find you""re family later on...the coast guards might not have given up their search just yet..."" Seighart ran his hands smoothly on the boy""s back, hoping to suppress the tremors brought by crying. ""You think so?"" Haru looked at him, with wide eyes. Seighart blushed lightly at this, caught off guard. "" Yes...I do..."" Haru finally stopped crying and angrily wiped at his tears. Julius caught up with them, with Elie in tow. Gale followed smoothly after them, eyeing Haru from a distance. He felt relieved. Because for the first time of the day, Haru smiled again, a genuine smile. All five arrived in school just in time, except for the minor difference of Haru being called to office as the administration has been informed of the said mishap of Haru""s family. He was given special pass to leave at anytime of the days to go with excused absence and compensation of grades until he be given news of his family. Haru thanked the school""s grace and consideration and hurriedly informed of his friends. ""Seig, I""d like to ask you a favor..."" Haru turned towards the azure blonde. ""Yes, Haru?"" ""I don""t know much of where to go where I might be able to find news of my family. Can you accompany me later on? I asked the board and he gave you the same privilege as I have..."" ""Hey! Why only him? What about us?"" Julius and Elie mouthed out in retort. Seighart decided to answer it for Haru. ""Haru and I have the same schedule of classes, so I don""t think it will be a bother for me."" Haru added in. ""Besides, you""re teachers intervened when I asked them about both of you. Uh...they said you had to work on your grades, so they weren""t keen in cutting you some slack...Seighart however, excels in all of his classes, so they said it was okay for him..."" Haru scratched the back of his head ruefully. Julius and Elie just kept mumbling about rowdy teachers and their ways of getting into student""s lives. Seighart and Haru bid them momentary goodbyes as they went outside the school to find news of Haru""s family. ""So where do we start, Seighart?"" Both walked side by side towards downtown. The sun seemed a bit more cheery than now and the birds, a bit more noisy. ""We can start good with going to the port first and ask for the coastguards there. They have first hand information of what would be going on. Then, we could go to the local newspaper house and then finally, the bar shacks on the port..."" ""Bar shacks?"" Haru eyed him weirdly, hearing the two words for the first time. ""They""re bars situated near the fisherman""s villages, and offer drinks to the men after a night""s fishing. People like them also have firsthand news with anything that goes on the sea."" ""I get it..."" Haru nodded in understanding. Both halted by the bus stop and took the nearest route towards the coastguard""s office. Haru explained the situation well to the officer, who gave his sincerest condolences to the boy. Haru accepted it graciously and left the number of the Shiro Honya in case they have news. They then took the route towards the newspaper printing press.",583064
455,"He thought he never escape the wrath of those torments he suffered in the underworld or hell as many people called it in this era. Cautiously, he sat up and held his head within his hands as he tried to ebb away the tiny headache he had from the new light. However it didn""t take long to subside, before he began looking around and found his once mummified servants surrounding him. However, what shocked him was a ghost; a person he hadn""t seen in centuries. Yet there she stood, only a different woman in this new era. This woman was no more than around the ages of 19 or 20. She had this reddish-brown hair that mimicked the hue of dried blood, yet glistened from the torches in the room that had been previous lit. She had a well-built body but overly so since she was still a bit petite. She had on some Arabic looking clothes of a belly dancer and she was holding within her hand The Book of the Dead. Imhotep took a closer look at her eyes and smiled at what he saw. It was her, Princess Jamila, Anck-Su-Namun""s daughter reincarnated. ""Welcome back Imhotep,"" Jamila spoke in his native language, while bowing her head at him as he got to his feet. Giving another quick glance around the room, he instantly noticed a familiar form lying upon the alter. He growled deeply under his breath. That woman had betrayed him. She had loved him, but left him to die. If she was to be brought back then a few things would definitely needed to be set straight. Looking over to Jamila for conformation of what she was doing, he received his answer as she turned from him. The woman began to chant the incantation out once again from the book and soon he heard moaning and grunting coming from all around him. Looking around he found that his priests had been raised once again. Jamila began a ritual that he himself had never notice in the book, and had apparently skipped over. She began to give part of her spirit to Anck-Su-Namun. It was obvious though the consequences of this ritual however. If Jamila was to die so would Anck-Su-Namun, but if Anck-Su-Numun died then the little portion of the spirit she was giving her would only come back to Jamila. Jamila sat the book down upon the alter, and pulled a dagger out from within her bag. Slicing it across her palm, she held it over the mummified body of Anck-Su-Namun. Then, turning back to the book, she returned to reciting the incantation. Imhotep watched as Anck-Su-Namum""s spirit slowly formed on top of the murky water, and began to float toward her mummified body. Within moments the spirit spread over her like a purple jam, and soaked into her skin. Suddenly a gargled gasp was heard as she awakened from her eternal sleep. However, ignoring this event laid out before her, Jamila didn""t skip a beat as she continued on with incantation. As she did so, Imhotep watched a golden glow surrounded the young girl, and slowly seep onto the table before cautiously creeping it""s way over to the gasping mummy. The moment the golden glow touched Anck-Su-Namun rotting corpse, organs took shape, and muscle began to form.",806976

The three of them seize the opportunity to talk in great detail about Clark""s second life as Superman, and Clark realizes again how much he enjoys to have someone to talk to about all of this. But one evening Moirag manages to ambush Jimmy on his way home and to take his place. She carries a little camera, and she has manipulated the next TV station, so that she""ll be live on air as soon as she switches the camera on. And when Lois and Clark innocently talk with the supposed Jimmy about ""Clark""s results"", Moirag has the final proof that Clark Kent is Superman. While Clark tells them what he did today as Superman, she switches on the camera, and the evening news on all screens in Metropolis are interrupted by Clark Kent revealing his secret identity... It happened. The whole of Metropolis knows now about Clark. What will the reactions be like? A very nice thing about this episode are the long conversations between Clark, Lois and Jimmy that show once again how fast this trust between the Kents and their young friend is growing.5.20: Redemption (Part 2 of 2) Special guest star: Terry Kiser (H. G. Wells), Tracy Scoggins (Cat Grant) The whole of Metropolis is flabbergasted: Clark Kent is Superman! Perry White promptly visits Clark, completely baffled, stammering ""Dear Elvis in heaven!

But on the next day there""s no way out: Clark has to face the press. Lois and Jimmy try to support him as much as possible. The whole thing gets more difficult when Cat suddenly turns up and tries everything to get her share of the limelight. Some weeks later, things calm down and Clark starts to get used to the thought that his secret is now revealed. But the underworld has learned the news as well, and soon Clark receives the first threats. Clark""s family, as well as his friends and colleagues at the ""Planet,"" are suddenly in constant danger of being used as a means of exerting pressure on Clark. Fortunately, H. G.

Together they find that the world is not yet ready to know the truth about the Man of Steel... Although Moirag is taken back to her time prison by Clark and H. G. Wells, Clark cannot rest.

3562,"Within a few minutes though, Haymitch realized this man""s interest wasn""t in Effie. He continuously talked about the Seam boy""s pretty eyes. Haymitch struggled not to throw up on this man""s pretty suit and part of him would have done it gladly. But he didn""t want to deal with the fallout from Effie. Finally the older man said, ""Send the boy some bread."" ""Actually, I get to decide what he needs."" Haymitch reminded him. With a firmer tone, the man repeated, ""Send the boy some bread."" Haymitch understood the man""s attentions all too well. He also knew that if the boy somehow made it through what the Capitol would do. This was why he hated courting sponsors; they reminded him that there were worse things than a career""s spear through the chest. Back in the penthouse, Effie was happy to see the bread, as was the boy, and nearly hugged Haymitch until the look he gave her stopped her cold. The earthquake was what ultimately killed their last tribute. The boy had been trapped under some rocks. As he was still alive, Effie tugged on Haymitch""s sleeve. ""Do you think that the sponsor would send him something? Could he still live?"" Haymitch thought that the man might, but refused to indebt the boy like that, so he answered, ""No. There""s nothing we can do."" Effie looked very distressed by this news and watched until a few hours after, the cannon sounded, as the boy""s heart beat had stopped. Haymitch barely reacted, but Effie let out a gasp. It didn""t take long for her to recover though, ""We""ll just have to try harder next year."" ""That""ll work,"" Haymitch grumbled under his breath. Effie ignored him, ""Well, I""ll call the family."" She got up, but Haymitch stopped her. ""They won""t have a phone."" ""Oh. Well, I guess we""ll do it in person then when we deliver the coffins."" ""What are you talking about? There is no we. You don""t say anything to the families because there is nothing to say."" ""Don""t be silly. We""ll let them know they died honorably in the Games and..."" ""They won""t care. They won""t want to hear it. You won""t be comforting them. They won""t love you for it. They""ll hate you, you stupid Capitol bitch."" She yelled now, ""It""s my job. I have to say something."" ""It""s not your job, Effie. None of the other escorts ever came back with the coffins. It won""t matter anyway."" Effie recognized that Haymitch had gotten her name right, but she ignored that, simply saying, ""It matters to me."" Haymitch said nothing. He knew she wouldn""t be welcome, but he found himself admiring her for making the effort. No one else did, not even him. As predicted, both of the families reacted badly to Effie""s words. One slammed the door shut in her face and the other spit at her feet before slamming the door shut. Effie wasn""t one to be put out though, and she acted as if it had all gone very well. Haymitch had refused to go with her to deliver the coffins, but did see her off at the station. She was smiling again, ""At least we""ll go to the Victor""s Ball."" ""What?"" ""At the President""s house. All the past victors are invited; I figured I could be your date.",1497577

As he crumples to the ground, she hears the screams of a little girl. She glances over her shoulder, and curses when she realizes that the man""s daughter is standing on the other side of the school fence. The little girl is dressed in a Bambi shirt, and has her blonde hair up in pigtails. She""s too little to understand what is going on, and Emma can""t stop to explain.

Joran Vander Plaats is a jackass who needs to pay for his crime, and he""s the one ultimately responsible for what is happening. He is the one who needs to bear the blame for traumatizing his child. She turns her head away, wondering why all she can think of is the Hunter in Bambi, and if he ever turned around and saw a fawn standing off in the distance. It""s funny that he""s considered one of the greatest villains of all when he might have simply been trying to put food on the table. The Hunter never gets a chance to explain his side of the story. The Strand is a legacy theater that""s approaching its 100th anniversary. There""s a plaque on the wall in the lobby - decorated in cheap, replicated 1930s décor - that explains the theater was originally built in 1913, right before The Great War, and was one of the first places in Maine to show talkies in 1927. It""s been refurbished twice since then, once in the seventies and again in the nineties. The glitz suits the place, because she knows that all it would take is a couple of good scrapes to unearth the dross that""s underneath. Emma thinks it""s about due for round three with the decorators. It""s the only theater in town, and it shows movies about a month after their initial release date. She""s heard Ruby complain about having to wait so long to see the latest Twilight film, but the next nearest theater is over fifty miles away. If Storybrooke""s residents want to see a movie, they have to see it here. ""If you get the tickets right now, we""ll be able to get the best seats,"" Henry says.

1050,"He was smiling at her just like how he smiled when he left her. But it was different this time. ""Athrun...!"" Nothing mattered to her as she flung her arms around his waist, her fragile form crashing into his arms as she seek for sanctuary. It was one of those instances when she allowed herself to cry. The salty tears mingled with dirt and rainwater all trailed down her cheek then down his shirt. The umbrella he was holding fell off his grasp. She caught him off guard. To her surprise, she felt his palm rubbed her back as if soothing her. There was silence as they stayed at that position for the longest time. It didn""t matter anymore if Athrun lost his memories. It didn""t matter if it is running away. It didn""t matter if they were only friends. Maybe... even just for a day... she could forget all these things. s s It was the sound of crashing waves that reminded Cagalli of him. Whenever she thought about it, the sounds brought melancholy unto her. This is the reason why she hated coming to the beach. There were just so many memories that the innocent place reminded her. But now, she found herself standing in a beach. It was again one of her mind""s indestructible ideas. Somehow, she wanted herself to be reminded of all the times she shared with Athrun. It lingered in her mind but she pushed it away. Will it hurt to remember all those things especially with Athrun by her side? It was a question she tried to ask herself during their trip but the answer wouldn""t just pop up. The sight that was presented before took her breath away. The majestic sun hovered just above the horizon, throwing an orange-with-red-and-yellow hue all over the sky. The sea itself was calmly orange, silent although deep down, it bustled with life. Sea gulls gawked above them, the shipping vessels that were small due to their distance looked like miniature toys that she could reach. It was a peaceful sight to be enjoyed. Cagalli took a deep breath. The air here is definitely different from the city. It was lighter and fuller. She stood there in silence as she savored the view. Athrun watched her with a gentle smile. She looked beautiful against the setting sun, her light gown flickered as she moved, and her hair glowed in the rays and her eyes were content- an emotion he seldom found on her golden orbs. ""Athrun.. what do you think about the sea?"" she suddenly inquired as she turned her head to look at him. Athrun sighed and thought for a while. The sea? ""It is a huge body of water."" It was slow yet evident: Cagalli pouted. It was another first for Athrun. ""You""re no fun!"" she mouthed, her voice coming out like an innocent remark from a child. Then, as suddenly as her mood changed, she flashed him an innocent grin and pulled him into the water. Athrun blinked but it wasn""t due to the coldness of the water but solely due to Cagalli""s happiness. It was pure... it was true. It wasn""t the happiness she showed to the media this morning. She was... just being her self. She let go of his arms and ran further into the water that it reached her knees. ""Come and get me, Athrun!",560480
2633,"Apparently though, the girl was enamored with D. It wouldn""t be the first time he""d had a stalker, but it""d be the first time he""d had one so persistent. It was his ridiculous beauty. D hated being as beautiful as he did. He hated it when all the girls gasped and turned into jelly at the sight of him. Badly, D wanted to tell all those droves of admiring girls that he wasn""t interested. Some days, he could ignore them. On other days it took D""s all not to rip off somebody""s head and hiss at the survivors. All he wanted was to be left the fuck alone. D""s persistent need for isolation had only increased after the love of his never ending life had died in the most gruesome fashion imaginable, courtesy of his father. The old monster would never be satisfied, his diseased mind would never cease to concoct ever more elaborate ways to torment his son. More than ever, it was necessary to stamp out the Sacred Ancestor. In the past centuries, the image of D""s long dead love appeared to him in dreams and gave him essential clues to finding and defeating his father. Now though, the voice of that one perfect woman had grown silent. In his desperation, D increasingly resorted to drugs and hallucinogenic compounds to hear that sweet voice. No matter how much he seemed to shoot into his veins, dear Luna never appeared. He just had too much to worry about to even care about that stupid girl that was stalking him. Asenath looked at the castle; it was the apotheosis of all Noble architecture, big, beautiful, opulent and intimidating. Despite the fact that the castle had been built from materials which would last for ten thousand years without maintenance, the giant edifice was crumbling. Nature and the elements were breaking down the castle structure faster than its Noble builders had anticipated. For three months, Asenath had watched D going in and out of the castle hauling various armloads of plants. One time, Asenath had been D hauling a sack full of hell lilies. That was some serious shit, in its pure form the hell lily was capable of frying even the brain of a vampire. If D was doing drugs, she had to put a stop to it. Having had no permanent home since the age of five, Asenath had seen what happened to drug addicts during her tenure on the streets. Addicts were literally eaten alive by their chemical dependence. It was all very clear in her mind, she""d go up there and confront D about his problem is he had one. At first he might be angry but as he was rehabilitated he would show her gratitude. Gratitude would bloom into love and Asenath would have somebody that she cared about other than herself. It would be romantic, her own little gothic romance. D would be the silent, stoic groom and she""d be the talkative, lively bride. Surprisingly, the castle door wasn""t locked and all the security systems were either deactivated or didn""t function. It was like walking into Stephen King""s Dark Tower series, all around you the splendor of ages past was worn and decaying, the supposedly permanent slo-trans engines were on their last legs.",1220273

I have seen you grow up, I saw you the first day you walked into OZ and you were merely a lost soul, you didn""t know what way to go and you were trapped, Shillenger had trapped you and exploited you, humiliated you, and I had wanted so badly to reach out to you, show you that there was another way but I knew that this was a lesson you had to learn on your own---"" ""Some lesson I learned..."" Said smiled sweetly before going on. ""He had made you into a victim Beecher, but you escaped him and became a victimizer, you broke free of the hold Shillenger had on you and you hit him back with all you had, taking the dignity that was yours to begin with, all yours Beecher. You have changed so much from the person that walked in here, you are a brave soul Tobias Beecher and I am glad to say you are my friend and if you love Christopher Keller---- so be it."" Beecher and Said stared at each other, once again, taking in the silence and then Beecher wrapped his arm around Said""s neck pulling him in for a hug, the hug lasted a bit longer then it should have. Keller glared at the scene, Keller knew he wasn""t the only prisoner in the hospital that was watching what was going on between Beecher and Said, he knew that the other prisoners in the hospital were staring at ""them"" and that made him even more upset. Watching Said and Beecher, had made him jealous before too, but his jealousy vibes were going crazy--- maybe it was because Said had come to Beecher""s rescue that day in the library ---- because he did something that Keller couldn""t do himself, but the jealousy was definitely there. ""Oooh K-boy, I think you""re getting green"" Keller snapped his icy blue eyes away from Said and Beecher and examined the injured body of Ryan O""Reily, who was pulling his white wifebeater over his head with care. ""Shit, you look like shit man"" O""Reily tossed a sarcastic smile at Keller and winced a bit, when he jumped down from the hospital bed --- O""Reily strolled over to Keller""s bedside and leaned against it. ""Heard you got back K-boy and to think if I never tore my stitches I would never saw ya, fate eh?"" Keller smirked, he glanced at O""Reily""s face and could tell that O""Reily was thinking of something. ""So... what are we gonna do about Johnson? I""ve heard the rumors O""Reily and if I know you, which I do, I know you have to get rid of him without actually getting caught, you got to make it look good."" O""Reily""s smile got wider, he slapped Keller on the back. ""See that is what I love about us, no need to speak, we already know what the other one is thinking about. Give me a holler once you get back to Emcity and out of this hospital, fuck I hate that hospital smell, ya know? Well better be going, Cyril is probably freaking out without me"" Keller snorted out a laugh. ""Say hi for me"" O""Reily looked over his shoulder and half smiled at Keller.",29783
1777,"""Why don""t you tell us about it there lad? Talking about her might help."" Gimli nosily instructed while settling himself in hopes of a story. ""I do not feel only longing for her. I feel regret for what I had done to her."" ""What had you done?"" Pippin asked, Boromir swallowed, guilt rising in his every muscle. The hobbits knew little of love, they were too innocent to understand the desires and mistakes of man, but Boromir meant to please them in its knowledge. ""She is beautiful."" ""They all are."" Gimli criticized, the company glaring at him to shut him up. They then turned back to Boromir who continued. ""She gave me this cloth as a token. She had woven it herself."" Boromir spread open the purple laced square marred with dirt and torn at certain parts. ""I have kept it for long because it is my luck."" ""She gave it to you before she left?"" Sam asked, unconsciously licking his lips. Boromir looked around at all of them and shook his head. ""No. She gave it to me before I went to battle. I had met her in the market a week prior to the attack on the city Osgiliath, where more of Mordor""s forces were closing in on Gondor... Boromir smiled as he allowed his love, for now to her his friend, guide him through the crowded pathways of Gondor""s City. Her blond hair flowed down her shoulders like waterfalls and her pale skin glimmered in the sunlight leaking between the high towers. Her blue moonstone dress was covered partially by a black cloak which was tied around her neck, the hood hanging down the back. The sleeves finished from her mid shoulder to her wrists. Her nimble hand holding his battle-clad fingers and dragging him slog through the common people. He chuckled. ""Slow down Kierra, we have plenty of time."" She paused grabbing his other hand with her free one, in which he was given that glorious opportunity to stare into her milky blue eyes. ""I know, but I""m just so excited to show you my gift."" Her voice screamed eagerness and zealous opportunity, she then tugged him along again in which he frowned. They didn""t have plenty of time, in these few days he had fallen in love with this common girl, daughter to a wealthy merchant. If his father knew he would be expelled from Gondor, his father would not allow him to marry a woman of low birth, but she carried herself so godly. She had the beauty of a princess, the strength and determination of a queen... He loved her, but was uncertain whether or not she felt the same. He had to leave tomorrow, tomorrow he would head for the ruins with his army to fend off the Orcs who threatened to take settlement there. He did not want to leave her so soon, especially since he hadn""t told her yet. Despite his father he had full intentions of asking her hand in marriage... He just needed more time, time that was not plausible at the moment. ""So what exactly is this prize?"" ""It""s a gift not a prize. You""ve done nothing worth rewarding."" She teased, winking over her shoulder at him. He grinned brightly. ""Well what would you consider an achievement worth a reward?"" ""Perhaps seeing me more would be something I would reward.""",6234395
348,"""Well then, Ser Bronn,"" I shrugged once, feigning disinterest and turning once again to my work, ""Good day to you."" ""And to you as well, Synne Sand."" Once his footsteps faded away, I breathed a sigh of relief. My heart thumped hard in my chest. I wanted to believe it was a coincidence, that maybe there was another Tysha trying to live under another name with a bastard daughter. This Bronn hadn""t expected me, so it was always a possibility, but... good god, Tyrion Lannister? The few stories I""d heard in my little hovel of the south were equal parts fantastical and worrying. How he""d defended King""s Landing from the armies of Stannis Baratheon, how he had a soft spot for whores, but was one of the most intelligent men to ever take the role of Hand of the King. If that man was the one who harassed my mother, I would probably be hunted down and killed soon, now that she was dead. If... if he was my father, then... I had to take a break from planting, my hands were shaking too much. The fox padded over, nudging against one of my hands. I scratched yours ears. ""How about Florys?"" It was the name of the fox from one of the funnier stories Mother would tell me as a child. The fox tilted her head, and when I scratched her ears again, she made a small, happy sound. My eyes lifted, in the direction the sellsword had vanished, ""Yes, that""ll be your name."" The unsettling knot in my stomach still wouldn""t leave. Bronn came to the hut a week later. Averill had already given me a giddy earful about getting visited by a dashing knight. I laughed at her. Dashing? The man was at least twice my age. He was gruff with a crudeness about him, but all she saw was his weathered gambeson and sword. He told me that Tyrion Lannister would be visiting. He didn""t ask my permission, and I didn""t expect it. What noble ever asks permission? It wasn""t like I didn""t expect it, but still... I was nervous. Bronn didn""t stay long, asking a few more questions Tyrion probably sent him via raven. The Eddars were all in a frenzy when I told them that the Hand of the King would be staying with the local Lord, Ryon Allyrion, specifically to visit me. Averill, in particular, was all in titters about it. ""You must be his bastard!"" She clapped her hands together, smiling broadly, ""I heard in town from Tristan, who heard from his uncle, who went to King""s Landing last year that Tyrion Lannister is one of the last Lannister""s alive, and has no known true or baseborn children! He could come to legitimize you!"" ""It""s up to King Jon to legitimize anyone,"" I muttered as I skinned some desert rabbits I""d caught the day before, ""Besides, I don""t know what he wants.

I shot her a look, ""My mother always taught me that nothing comes without a price. Who tracks down a bastard just to legitimize them, unless they wanted something?",748687
2948,"""Did Yuuhi come home?"" Aki entered the kitchen. ""Yes, about 3 in the morning. He just left a while ago,"" Suzumi answered, eyes focused in a certain spot in the kitchen. ""If this continues, Yuuhi will be sick!"" Aki slammed his fist in the table, ""Damn! Chidori, where are you!"" -------------------------- ""What""s wrong Chidori?"" Nuriko asked. They were doing the laundry. ""I thought I heard Aki""s voice..."" Chidori looked up and studied the weather. Sunny day. ""Aki? Voice?"" Nuriko was puzzled. ""It might have been my imagination,"" Chidori continued her work. ""Who is this Aki anyway? Is he your boyfriend?"" Chidori laughed. ""He""s only a friend of mine."" ""Chidori-neesan! Let""s play!"" Chiriko came running towards them. ""Chiriko, we still need to finish the laundry. Maybe later, okay?"" Chidori patted the young boy""s head. ""But..."" Chiriko pouted. ""Later. Or else we are not going to have lunch under the Sakura tree,"" Nuriko threatened. ""Lunch under the Sakura? Yippee!!!"" Chiriko started to jump like crazy. They watch him ran back to the house.----------------------------- ""Where is this Sakura tree?"" Chidori asked as they went inside. They have just finished the laundry. ""It is a tree in the park near here. Of course, there are many Sakura trees there but that one is in the middle and very memorable for us,"" Nuriko explained. ""I see.."" Chidori said. They proceeded to the kitchen. ""Let""s see..."" Nuriko started opening various cabinets. ""What are you doing?"" Chidori asked. ""Preparing for the picnic! Could you help me?"" ""I am not a good cook...like...."" An image of Yuuhi flashed through her mind, ""you..."" She shook her head to let the image vanish. Why think of him? He loves Aya and nothing could change that. Nuriko didn""t notice that Chidori""s face darkened,""It is okay. Just help me with the ingredients."" ""Okay..."" she smiled and began taking out ingredients.------------------------- ""We are going to have picnic! We are going to have picnic!"" Chiriko sang as they proceeded to the park. ""Stop it, Chiriko. Don""t make it rain!"" Chichiri covered his ears. Chiriko pouted. They reached the park and proceeded to the Sakura tree in the middle. Chidori was astonished with the tree. It was really old. It was the biggest tree around. Its mighty branches supported the beautiful flowers. ""It is so nice, isn""t it?"" Hotohori walked beside Chidori. She blushed. ""It is,"" Chidori continued to stare at the tree, once in a while, stealing a glance at Hotohori. ""Chidori! Hotohori! Lunch is ready!"" Miaka called even they were only a few meters apart. ""We are only here, no need to shout,"" Hotohori said as he sat down opposite Nuriko. ""Because, it looks like you two are wandering somewhere..."" Miaka whispered to Chidori. Chidori blushed. ""It""s not that..."" Chidori said while Miaka just giggled. She sat down beside Nuriko, opposite Miaka and Tamahome. When everyone was settled, they started to eat. ""Itadakimasu!"" Numerous voices echoed through the air as they chat among each other. Chidori listened as Mitsukake lectured Tamahome on herbal medicines.",560480
491,"Morgan chuckled and I attempted to glare; not something I""m known to be good at, ""Whoa, boy. I like you, but I don""t like you."" And... there it goes; I felt my face warm up and I quickly stepped back. He, being the man that he was, laughed at the look on my face, causing my cheeks to darken further, ""Hey, relax man. I was just joking. Anyway, were""s Hotch and Rossi?"" ""In there,"" I pointed to the room the two were in. Morgan and Emily started down the hallway before I could even register it; which is pretty fast, ""Wait, did you find anything out?"" Morgan swung open the door and Emily and I followed him in, ""Hotch, Dr. Smith is in custody now; we barely had to flash our badges before he spilled. Told us everything her knew."" He smirked. ""Well?"" Hotchner set down his papers and looked at the two of them, ""What did you find out?"" ""Wasn""t much, though... except... He was the family doctor for the Christenson family,"" Morgan said as he and Emily took seats at the table; I was much too tense at the moment, ""He said that a man named Xavier Reynolds approached him and said he would give him ten-thousand dollars yearly for anything and everything regarding Nephilim Christenson""s condition. The good doctor agreed and reportedly gave him the information until Nephilim was ten years old, a little while before her eleventh birthday. Then the Christenson""s were killed and Nephilim went missing; according to the doctor, she was taken shortly after he had reported to Reynolds that Nephilim had..."" ""... reached puberty and started having her period,"" Emily finished for him. She sighed and continued, ""After that, the doctor swears he never heard from him again until seven years ago, when Reynolds showed up, willing to pay a quarter of a million dollars for semen samples from the St. Mary""s sperm bank. The donors had to match a specific height, weight, hair color, eye color, hair length, IQ, and multiple other factors."" ""Do you have a list of these characteristics?"" Hotch asked as he placed his chin in his hands. ""No; he only told us the ones he could remember,"" Emily shook her head, ""He said he couldn""t even remember the exact measurements and numbers, either. When Reynolds found out that Dr. Smith fit these requirements, he paid an extra ten thousand for Dr. Smiths"" sperm. He described Reynolds as neurotic and paranoid but with enough money to give his receptionist a fifty to let him talk to Smith when he was in the middle of a patient consultation."" ""Anything else?"" Hotchner questioned. Prentiss nodded and pulled out a list; a list of seven locations in Las Vegas, ""He told us where they probably are.""",748687
1921,"Elle wouldn""t have been surprised if the skeleton started screaming. ""Okay everyone, don""t touch it,"" Brand said authoritatively, kneeling down and examining it. ""There""s nothing to worry about,"" Stef assured Andy, who was sobbing uncontrollably into her shoulder. ""You don""t understand!"" she gasped. ""Don""t be afraid. Deep breaths, deep breaths!"" she coached her friend. ""He""s dead for sure,"" Mouth quavered. ""I think it""s Chester Copperpot,"" Elle shook. ""Who?"" everyone asked. ""In the attic,"" she started. ""There was this article about a guy named Chester Copperpot. He went looking for the rich stuff in like, 1937. They saw him go in, but they never saw him come back out!"" A new thought struck Elle. ""Oh, God! If he didn""t make it out and he was an expert, what about us?"" ""We can""t be sure it""s him,"" Mikey said. ""I""m sure it""s him,"" Elle said firmly. ""I bet his I.D. ""s in his wallet. Someone get his wallet!"" Mikey dug through the skeleton""s satchel and produced the faded leather wallet. ""You""re right,"" he said grimly. ""Chester Copperpot,"" he flashed the I.D. at them. Everyone groaned. ""We""re gonna get killed!"" Data shouted. Mikey rummaged through the bag some more. ""Hey, look at this!"" he pulled out several wax-like rods. ""Candles!"" Data took them and ran off. ""Hey, where""re you going?"" ""I""m setting booty traps!"" he called back. ""Booby traps."" ""That""s what I said, booty traps!"" Brand rolled his eyes and was about to leave when his foot kicked something. ""Hey, guys, look,"" he gingerly lifted a medallion out of the dirt. ""It""s like a skeleton of One-Eyed Willy or something."" ""Give me that. Give me this,"" he added to the skeleton. The medallion was attached to a long piece of twine around Chester""s neck. Mikey tried to remove it, and Chester""s head came off. Everyone yelped. Brand quickly replaced the skull onto the neck and wiped his hands on Mouth""s jacket, who looked like he was about to cry. ""Hey, guys. Look at this. See what I""ve found?"" Mikey held up some string that was hidden in the dust. He tugged at it, and then there was a sudden swish! from behind. Everyone looked wildly around and saw that Mikey had actually set off a chain reaction. ""Guys, freeze. Don""t move. Hey you guys! Back there! Don""t move a muscle!"" Then Mikey noticed that the boulders perched up at the ceiling were beginning to sway. ""RUN YOU GUYS, RUN!"" He yelled. They didn""t need telling twice. Everyone stumbled up, kicking up dust as they did so. Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Andy, and Stef ran ahead while Elle hobbled along. Halfway through, Mikey felt the familiar squeezing in his chest. His breath came out in a wheeze. He coughed, and Elle turned around. ""You okay?"" ""Okay."" He could barely get the words out. ""Use your inhaler!"" she urged him. ""Gave it- Mouth- to hold-"" he coughed. ""Good place for it. Mouth!"" she called. He turned around. ""What?"" ""I need Mikey""s inhaler, he""s coughing real bad..."" BOOM! the first boulder had dropped. ""Data?"" Elle called nervously. ""HOLY S-H-I-T-!"" he screamed back, flying down the hallway past Elle. Mouth reached into his pocket.",2855986

The young one pouted, ""I am not a girl...And my name is Chiriko."" ""I""m so sorry!"" Chidori apologized. ""You don""t need to, Chidori. Chiriko is always mistaken as girl,"" Mitsukake said after regaining his composure. His face was red from too much laughing. ""Um...why am I here?"" Chidori asked after a while. ""Hotohori said that he saved you from being hit by a truck."" ""Hotohori?"" ""Yes, he is my brother,"" Chiriko explained. Just then, a man with long hair entered. ""Brother!"" ""Hello, I see you are awake,"" Hotohori smiled at Chidori. Chidori could feel herself blushing. ""Tha..Thank you for saving me last night..."" ""Why did you do that?"" Mitsukake asked. ""It""s a long story..."" They sensed that Chidori don""t want to talk about it so they just fell silent. ""Breakfast is ready!!!"" a voice announced. ""Come now, Chidori! I""ll introduce you to everyone!"" Chiriko pulled Chidori""s hand. ""Now, Chiriko. Chidori is still weak and she needs to change her clothes,"" A woman entered. She has a long hair that was braided all the way down. ""Good morning, I am Chidori,"" Chidori introduced herself. ""I am Nuriko. Anyway, could you please go out while Chidori gets change?"" The guys went out leaving the 2 girls alone. ""I hope this is okay,"" Nuriko handed her a pink dress. She got changed. ""It looks nice on you,"" Nuriko surveyed Chidori. ""Thank you."" ""Anyway, let""s go down now,"" They exited the room.---------------------------------- Chidori was introduced to Tamahome and his wife Miaka. Chichiri, a monk, was also introduced. They had breakfast except for a man who walked out after seeing Chidori. ""Who is he?"" Chidori asked Miaka. ""He is Tasuki. He is such a brat so don""t mind him."" ""Chidori, do you like my cooking?"" Nuriko asked. ""It""s delicious."" ""Unlike someone there..."" Chichiri said. ""Are you talking about me?"" Veins began appearing at Miaka""s temple. ""Didn""t say any name..."" ""Chichiri!!!"" While Chichiri and Miaka started to fight, Chidori started to think about Yuuhi. She was currently eating mackerel, and that intensified the thought. ""Are you alright, Chidori?"" Hotohori asked. ""I am alright. Just thinking..."" ""You could stay here as long as you want. And we are all here for you, so don""t hesitate if you want someone to talk to."" ""Thank you."" -------------------------------- ""Tasuki!"" Mitsukake called. ""What do you want?!"" Tasuki snapped. He was sitting on a branch of a tree. ""Why don""t you go and meet Chidori? She is a nice girl."" ""Why do you all like her? What if she is a spy sent by Seiryuu?"" ""I don""t think so."" ""Aw, come on! Things like that could happen."" ""Tasuki!"" Nuriko came out of the kitchen followed by Chidori. Tasuki immediately jumped off the branch and walked away. ""She is not a spy!"" Nuriko shouted at the retreating figure of Tasuki. ""Such a brat,"" Mitsukake walked inside the house. Nuriko just stayed where she was. ""Nuriko, why does he think I am a spy?"" Chidori asked.",560480
2940,"Another set of silence dawned upon them and only this time, the air felt slightly awkward. ""Hey Sof, since your sister is about to get married and all, have you ever thought about it yourself?"" he asked out of nowhere, surprising the princess. ""Well, at times I do."" she replied as she looked at the ground, clutching her book even more close to her. ""Who do you see... in that kind of future?"" Hugo asked once more, making Sofia blush. The moment she heard her question, she instantly thought of a person. ""James. Of course it""s him.' she thought sadly. ""None, as of the moment."" She lied. ""Then... would it be okay... if I stepped in your future?"" the raven-haired prince said. It didn""t fully register on Sofia""s mind as she stared at the prince blankly, not knowing how to respond. He was asking for marriage, in a way. Hugo, who looked out of his character and as red as a beet walked towards Sofia and pulled her for a hug. ""I... I kinda... l-like you."" he stuttered as he whispered in her ear. Sofia remained speechless. ""B-but... I didn""t know... you had... those kind of feelings... I""m-"" ""Sofia...? Hugo?"" a familiar voice overpowered Sofia""s meek one. Instantly, the two pulled away from each other, the dark-haired prince still as red as he was before. ""Nice seeing you, James. I""m just here to drop off your twin""s present."" Hugo said, showing James the box he was holding. On the other hand, James was staring at the other prince as if he was a deceitful enemy. ""There must be something wrong with your eyesight, then. The princess in your arms a few seconds ago happened to be Sofia, not my twin."" he said, not taking his eyes off Hugo. With a small frown, the other prince scoffed at James. ""It""s not like she""s yours for you to get so worked up like that."" he muttered before walking past James and outside the stable. ""Where""s Amber by the way?"" ""Lobby. At the entrance."" James replied, not looking back at him. The other prince nodded and walked away. As Hugo walked farther away, Sofia could feel that James was mad. As in really mad. As silence dawned upon them, she didn""t know what to do. Then, the blond prince walked towards her abruptly. Preparing herself for James"" anger, she closed her eyes. And instead of harsh words, she felt James"" arms wrap around her tightly. His embrace was so tight, as if he was so afraid of losing her. ""J-James?"" she muttered softly. James didn""t respond. He only hugged her tighter. ""O-ow..."" Sofia instinctively blurted out, making him pull away slightly. She looked up at him so that she can the expression on his face. Somehow, James looked flushed. ""Did Hugo say something to you?"" he asked. ""Well... he said confessed his feelings for me and asked who I want to spend my future with."" she replied. ""Who is it then?"" ""I told him that I wasn""t thinking of anyone. But the truth is... I thought of you."" Sofia said with a small smile, her cheeks glowing red. James, too was looking quite red as he heard what the princess just said. Brushing off his awkwardness, he pulled Sofia once more in to a tight hug.",2750536

2323,"After exploring every well-defined crevice covered by latex, she figured out how to remove the suit. But she only had it pulled off to his waist before he grabbed her wrists and rolled them, once again gaining the upper hand. He""d already figured out how to get hers off and he unzipped her costume. However as he slowly peeled the skintight garment from her to match his state of undress, he realized that fantasies aside, he""d never done this in the Batsuit. He hesitated. Would such an act cheapen Batman? Cheapen the Mission that Jason had paid the ultimate price for? Selina had come to the same realization as Bruce at the same time, but had no such hang-ups about cheapening what her costumed persona stood for. In fact, if she wanted to face the truth, while her suit was skintight due to the thieving nature of her work (after all it did no good to leave traces of evidence from loose clothes caught on snags), part of the design was completely sexual in nature to throw off Batman. But even as she felt the pleasure of victory, she noticed his dark face and could guess where his thoughts had taken him. She immediately placed two of her fingers under his chin to guide his face to look at hers. She spoke softly, ""Bruce, look at me. Come back to me."" Bruce""s eyes reconnected with hers for a moment, then drifted south. Selina enjoyed his gaze, but enjoyed his mouth grazing what he""d been studying so carefully even more. Her hands began to comb his hair as her hips pressed harder into his. Out of the corner of his eye, Bruce spotted his discarded belt. A plan formed instantly in his mind and he further distracted Catwoman, Selina, so she wouldn""t notice him grabbing something from his belt. Selina was taken completely off-guard when Bruce lifted them, but her confusion didn""t last long as Bruce""s mouth found hers once again. Eventually he stopped walking and laid her down gently. He then removed the remainder of her clothing as well as his own. For a moment, Selina was disappointed. Without the costumes they were just Bruce and Selina, who""d done this a million times before. That was until she realized what she was lying on. The Batmobile. And when Bruce joined her, entered her, he pushed a hidden button and revived the car""s engine. Selina could only describe the feeling as an instant explosion. So this was the sex that romance novelists made their living on, the kind of sex that made you just give in to death because nothing in life would ever be able to top this moment. The kind every person dreamed about, the kind she always knew she would have with Batman. She smiled. Even the fragmented remains of her over pleasured mind could piece together that costumes or not, tonight she""d be with the Batman she""d always wanted, and not the Bruce she""d always had. She fell apart in his strong arms, but they kept her steady and safe. She nearly laughed as she hugged him, she""d come here to save him, but he was always the hero. It was a familiar dance, but so different.",1497577

""Wow...I didn""t know this house looked just like mine even in the inside..."" Rei looked around, before following Yuuya up the stairs.

Rei idly sat on the edge of Yuuya""s bed, his eyes roaming his surroundings, only to have it settle down on the blonde taking his clothes off. Yuuya had a hard time taking the skimpy (or rather too-tight) turtleneck and was staggering across the room with the dark sweater over his head and his arms stretched upwards. Rei mildly chuckled before standing up and approached the blonde. ""Here...let me help."" He spoke gently, Yuuya stood in his place allowing Rei to bring the traitorous sweater over his head, heaving a sigh when it came off. Rei""s body shuddered uncontrollably when he saw Yuuya""s pale body once more. Err...remember the leather pants Yuuya wore? The one that was really tight? The one that was... ...riding low on his hips? ""Yuuya...you""re wearing boxers under those tight leather pants?"" Rei asked, pointing at the white drawers peeking out of Yuuya""s navel. ""Hey...they""re thin cotton drawers. I don""t want my hips chaffed from the leather..."" Yuuya looked equally consternated, asking why Rei was minding things like that. Rei didn""t reply on his part, but just stared at the mirror behind Yuuya and came near it, undoing the buttons on his polo, one by one. Yuuya was mightily impressed, as Rei kicked his pants down on the floor, leaving himself in his dark blue boxers. Shoving his discarded clothes into a neat pile by the mirror, he flopped down tonelessly onto the twin-size bed. ""Hey...where am I supposed to sleep?"" Yuuya pointed at himself, noting that Rei was a bit...big for the bed. ""Rei?"" Yuuya peered towards the brunette, smiling gently upon seeing Rei""s sleeping form. Edging gently on the side, he slid discreetly on the sheets, Rei""s back towards him. ""Goodnight, Rei..."" Yuuya whispered, before shutting his eyes, fatigue taking over for the night.

738,"He paused to look at the nation in front of him. She was blushing madly and still frozen in her place. ""Um, Claire? Are you mad at me?"" He asked, trying to keep a straight face. ""M-marriage?"" She suddenly yelled in his face. ""Whoa! Talk about bad hair day!"" Alfred said as he felt his Nantucket drop. ""Why are you asking me this NOW?"" She ordered him to answer with her glare at him. ""W-well, I wanted you to be not away from me! Even if you""re independent, we""re still together, right?"" He excused, but it was the truth. Clara""s blush went redder than usual. ""That""s really sweet of you, kuya but ""marriage"" between two countries is like ""being one"". As in as one country only. Didn""t you know that?"" Alfred gave her his confused look. ""So it""s like Austria-Hungary during the WW1?"" He dumbly asked. ""Yes, remember? They were married! But, they divorced because of political problems."" She explained properly. ""So, I can""t marry you, right?"" He sadly asked, worrying the other nation. ""I would really love to marry you but, it""s my peoples"" decision to make."" Alfred pouted his lips in disappointment. ""Aw man! And I gathered up all my courage to do this!"" Clara smiled at him sweetly. ""I appreciate that, kuya. If we were only normal people, I would surely marry you."" Alfred blushed lightly. ""If I can""t marry you, then let""s form an alliance."" He said with a small smile. ""But, we""re allies already."" She said confusingly. ""I know. An alliance that we will help each other no matter what happens. And, you""re also independent. It""s like marriage! Like normal people do! Let""s just minus the marriage ceremony, the priest, the godfathers and mothers and-"" ""We can have our own marriage ceremony minus the priest, the god fathers and god mothers."" She said with the usual blush. Alfred was speechless for a while then, smiled at her. ""Yeah. Our very own marriage ceremony. Our own alliance."" As they agreed unto this, they faced each other hurriedly. ""So, I""ll start, okay?"" Alfred inhaled then exhaled slowly. ""I, Alfred F. Jones, promise to be with Clara Carriedo de los Santos whatever happens. I also promise to be the best ally, friend, brother and lover for her. And, I promise to never leave her in times of hardships."" He grinned at her. Clara smiled at his promises, hoping it was true. ""And I, Maria Clara Carriedo de los Santos, promise to support Alfred F. Jones in whatever may happen. I promise to be at his side if ever he needs me. I promise to be the ally, friend, sister and lover for him. And finally, I promise to never leave him in whatever may happen."" Alfred smiled at her too. ""Now, what are we going to do?"" Clara asked. ""In normal marriages, after their vows, the priest usually says ""you may now kiss your bride.' so, yeah..."" Clara blushed when she heard ""kiss"". ""I-I am gonna kiss you?"" Alfred blushes too when she asked this question. ""I-it""s okay if you don""t want to. I mean, I-I won""t force you too."" Clara saw the diappointment of his face. ""I-it""s not that I dislike it! I-I gave you the permission to kiss me, right?"" ""Uh... no, actually.""",2750536
2422,"Merlin tugged at his mace, but lo and behold- it was tangled with the cage. As he struggled to free his weapon Arthur slowly approached him, trying to savor this moment of victory for him. The wheelbarrow tipped, Arthur swung- and missed Merlin by inches as he darted away in the nick of time. Arthur was showing no sign of relenting. He hurled his mace at Merlin again and again, Merlin dodging it each time. He kept advancing on Merlin, causing him to keep backing away: Merlin fell over in a wheelbarrow that was filled with sacks of flour. ""You""re in trouble now,"" Arthur said, a manic gleam in his blue eyes as he swung his mace around and around. Merlin looked around wildly for some sort of aid; then his eyes fell on two metal hooks hanging behind Arthur""s shoulder. With a slight tingle, Merlin made the hooks, well, hook together, Arthur""s mace wrapping around it. In those precious few seconds of freedom Merlin got up and faced his opponent again. I can win this with magic. With that in mind, Merlin tripped Arthur up by causing a rope on the ground to tighten, with Arthur falling flat on his face. He stumbled up, dazed. ""Do you want to give up?"" Merlin asked, hoping for the affirmative. ""To you?"" ""Do you? Do you want to give up?"" Merlin asked again, more forcefully than the last. This time it was Arthur backing up, Arthur who fell in the wheelbarrow. The townsfolk cheered- in his moment of glory, Merlin acknowledged them with a grin, his eyes landing on Lara first, who was standing there with a classic Merlin-you-idiot look on her face, and then Gaius, who was eyeing him with disapproval. Merlin""s grin faded. He paid for his lapse of concentration with a sharp jab in his back from Arthur, who had revived with the help of a broomstick. Arthur hit him in both his stomach and his head, and Merlin fell. Arthur, pleased with this turn of events, twirled the broom in his hand before sweeping Merlin away. Two of Arthur""s guards grabbed Merlin roughly by the arm. Merlin thought for sure he would be spending the night in jail again until Arthur said: ""Wait. Let him go. He may be an idiot, but he""s a brave one."" Arthur regarded Merlin with an unreadable expression. ""There""s something about you, Merlin. I can""t quite put my finger on it."" ""How could you be so foolish?"" Gaius scolded as soon as they set foot in the door of their quarters. ""He had to be taught a lesson,"" Merlin said, his voice hard. ""Magic must be studied, mastered, and used for good! Not for idiotic pranks! And you, Lara! You could""ve told him not to!"" Lara opened her mouth to protest but Merlin beat her to it. ""What is there to master? I could move objects like that before I could talk!"" ""Then by now you should know how to control yourself!"" ""I don""t want to!"" Merlin exploded. ""If I can""t use magic, what have I got? I""m just a nobody, and I always will be. If I can""t use magic, I might as well die."" He turned his back on them and went up to his chambers, slamming the door behind him.",2855986
2811,"""You should stop staring and defend yourself like you said you would,"" Ardeth said with a smirk. Jamila looked at him with as much hate and rage she could muster up and said, "" Oh I will believe me at that."" Jamila said kicking her foot around hitting Alex in the jaw and then scraped Ardeth""s stomach, which still hurt. Alex got up with a bleeding lip but nothing much other than that. Jamila noticed how Imhotep, Anck-Su-Namun, and the child were gone probably trying to get far away from the fight. She then noticed Ardeth retreat to the top of the train with Alex behind him. Jamila soon followed and found her hair whipping around her face and she quickly pulled out a tie and tied it to keep it out of her face. She looked around for those two but could not find them but what she did find was the ground as she was kicked from behind. She tried to get up but found another blow to the stomach as someone kicked her while she was down. She managed to roll over and see that Rick O""Connell was the cause of all the kicks. She sneered at him and then remembered a curse she had read in the book and mumbled it and soon the sand that was around them built up around him pushing him away. She got up and looked around and soon found the opened hatch and then she saw Ardeth come out as well as the Alex kid with no one. She then noticed the guards coming to the top of the train as well as they shot at them. Jamila let her small sand storm slow down enough for Rick to retreat. She looked up and found what looked like a huge balloon overhead. She also found that it was picking them up and that everyone was firing at them. ""Stop we need them for later so don""t shoot damn it,"" Jamila yelled in Egyptian over the roaring wind as the train moved fast. Every soldier stopped and held his gun down as they disappeared over a huge mound of sand. Jamila ordered everyone back down in the train which they followed her orders. She got back down herself as two of the soldiers helped her down and she thanked them for their help even though she never really needed help down. ""Damn it what happened Jabari, I""m away just for a little while leaving it to you and your soldiers screw up by letting them get past them,"" Jamila yelled. ""They disguised themselves as one of us miss we are sorry but we think they dropped into the storage part of the train where they dressed like us and walked around looking for the child,"" a soldier said looking at her with a very sincere look. She only nodded and then looked over at Jabari and pointed a finger at him and said, ""One more huge mistake Jabari and I""ll kill you my self."" With those words said she left to go see if he child was all right and when she found them they were acting like nothing had happened. Jamila finally took deep breaths and calmed herself thinking of a peaceful place and that was when she was pretty much on a beach near any body of water, as it would flow across her feet.",806976
1574,"---------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------- ""So like, Gungnir won the guild wars and managed to captivate even the favors of King Tristan III. That guild is awesome..."" A swordsman was telling a thief what he had heard on the PvP rooms. ""Right...but I still go for Black Lotus. Man, their guild master is way off our levels! Imagine...reaching level 99! Gosh, that hunter was burning with an aura!"" The thief related his own story. Byakko walked past them as he was still thinking where to go hunting next. The desert was boring him and the forest provided no challenge either. Zombies were way out of his league. ""Hey acolyte!"" A voice called from his back. Byakko""s ears perked up high, as he looked back at the swordie and the thief that had stopped talking to each other. ""Wanna come with us to the pyramids?"" The swordie smugly said. ""Yeah, were goin"" Skeleton Soldiers hunting."" The thief followed the swordsman""s pose. ""Well, if I""ll be staying in the sidelines, forget about it."" Byakko intercepted any thoughts from them. He knew they were looking for some support. ""I""m a battle acolyte see, and I don""t prefer just sitting around and healing anyone who gets slashed by a monster they have no business hitting with."" The swordie and thief huddled with each other. Byakko looked at both of them impatiently and waited for their answer. ""Uh, right...we""ll see each other another time...""The swordie gave a /swt. Byakko just piffed and gave a /an expression for the disturbance. But it does seem tempting to go to the Pyramids... With one final look at this zenny pouch, he asked a Kafra personnel to teleport him to the pyramids, back to Morroc. ""Step lightly, young sir! Enjoy the trip!"" Said the Kafra lady, as she directed Byakko to a strange teleporting machine. Byakko felt light headed for a few seconds, until he landed with a thump on the cobblestone streets of what he recognized as Morroc. After stocking on some meat drumsticks and concentration potions, Byakko finally entered into his first trip to the Pyramids. Level 1 was no biggie for him, it was just full of those pesky bats and powdery Spores. Other than that and those stupid-looking(but undeniably cute!) Poporings, he had no intention of staying at that level. Level 2 was a serious leap from the previous level as a Skeleton Soldier made a sudden jump towards him as he stepped off the door. Slightly dodging his attacks, Byakko nimbly gave a serious blow on the side of the Skel. The soldier flinched, but countered with a double attack. Byakko was starting to feel the desperation again, but felt it best to repress it for a while. There were many people around him, each trying to steal a bit of experience from the high-leveled players who were also hunting for the cards and the Apple o Archers that the Skeleton Archers dropped. Byakko thought it best to fly away for an easy escape.",583064
1457,"Andy couldn""t help, but be amazed out how huge the place was. She had never been to an Aquarium this big. Well she had been to one, but it hadn""t been very big. ""Did I mention how much I like you,"" Andy whispered to John. ""Yep, all the time,"" John said latching onto her hand and squeezing it as they came upon a huge tank with millions of different colored fish in it. ""Here we have schools of fish with a wide range of clown fish...."" And that""s where the sound stopped as Andy noticed someone far off that she hadn""t seen in a long time. It was Xavier""s class along with Bobby helping the teacher with the kids. She felt her body tense up and her hand tighten around John who didn""t seem to notice the change. Andy watched as a girl walked up to her cousin helping him with the children and when the kids weren""t looking she gave him a quick peck on the lips, but did not stay long. She must have been Rogue, because Bobby talked about her all the time. She was the one who was basically untouchable because of her mutation. Bobby and even voiced a few times how it did annoy him, but he made it through. ""Hey, come on,"" John whispered sweetly as he nudged her. Andy looked over at him and smiled nervously. He seemed to notice this and asked, ""What""s wrong babe."" ""Nothing, it""s just that I think the baby kicked,"" she said coming up with an excuse. ""Really,"" he said a little excited. ""Yeah,"" she said and he smiled as he led her down the hallway with the guide. As they passed the group of Xavier""s children John still didn""t realize them. Andy looked at her cousin longingly; no wishing that he would turn around and see her. She missed talking to him and she missed hugging him. John never let her talk to that part of the world anymore. He had taken away her cell phone and told her to forget them. She had joined the brotherhood and there was no going back. She felt bad for doing it, and she felt even worse for leaving them. Just as they were about to pass them completely, Bobby looked up and in her direction. His eyes widen as if not believing it for a second. Xavier and Rogue looked up too noticing Bobby""s state. Xavier looked straight through her and she could feel it. He was trying to read her. She held her head and turned away trying to push him out. John noticed Andy""s state and turned and that""s when Bobby must have realized that she wasn""t just a dream. ""ANDY,"" Bobby yelled running toward her. John looked up and glared. John in no way possible wanted to deal with him at the moment. Andy managed to set the mind blocks back up, but not before he saw a glimpse into her daily life. He saw what she had become and he felt pity, and she knew it. ""ANDY,"" Bobby said weaving through the crowds. ""Come on,"" John said pulling Andy""s hand to him as they began to weave through the crowds. ""ANDY,"" the girl said starting to call her name as if she hadn""t heard.",806976

It was true, somehow, Lexi always owed her food- but oddly enough, she rarely collected. As the two waded through the concession stand line, Lexi checked her phone. Two messages from Gene, and a picturemail from Melodie. ""Interesting..."" she murmured. Julie looked up from her phone to say something but her eyes narrowed as something behind Lexi. ""Don""t look now, but I think you have an incoming annoyance."" Lexi frowned. ""What?"" Micah and Gene, and even Melodie were safely back in Star City, and on their best they weren""t annoyances. Well, she amended, two out of three weren""t. ""McGinnis!"" a familiarly annoying voice sneered. ""So you do slum it with your cronies every once and awhile."" Lexi didn""t even spare Junior a look. The line shuffled forward, and the girls stepped up. ""Did you hear something?"" Lexi asked Julie. ""A fly, or something?"" Julie shrugged. ""Hey!"" Junior hissed. ""No one disrespects me, McGinnis. Especially not twice."" ""Funny, I thought you""d have to be capable of respect, for disrespect to be used."" Lexi muttered, loud enough that the couple in front chuckled at the barb. ""You think you""re something special, cuz your dad""s made?"" Junior fell back on his old adage. ""This feels like a repeat of last Thursday..."" sighed Lexi, moving up in the line. ""Junior, I do believe I am- at the very least- a special existence to you. You""re stalking me at almost professional levels."" ""Aw, looks like prep school has a crush."" Julie sang, snickering. His pale face reddened to almost scarlet. ""I""m not!- You""re a-! Fuck!"" he swore, stomping off. The girls high-fived one another. ""Very nice, Lady Hanson."" ""Thank you, Duchess McGinnis."" smirked Julie. ""Is this what private prep school was like?"" Lexi frowned. The truth or the watered down truth. Watered down. ""Oddly enough, no. It was more like ""who had the most expensive villa in the most tropical-slash-snowladen place. Or whose vacation cost the more money. Things like that..."" Julie mock gasped as they stepped to the front of the line. ""And yet you didn""t stay, and tell them of all the blissfully free vacations we have staying in Gotham."" She shook her head. ""For shame."" ""Thank you, Meryl Streep. Yeah, we""ll take a double order of cheese fries, the nacho combo platter, and the super sampler with mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and boneless wings."" ""Fifty-three creds."" the drone replied. Lexi exchanged the money in her fist for her credit card. They were five creds short. ""Your order will be out in...five minutes,"" the drone reported. As they waited, Lexi and Julie surveyed the skaters at the rink. ""He looks like he""s professional."" Julie murmured of one guy who strut across the main lobby like a peacock. Lexi wrinkled her nose.",3439302

The baby giggled. At that moment, Itachi envied Minato. Minato was two years younger and yet he was going to be an older brother before him? It was unfair! He wanted to have a baby too! But the question was how? Itachi had sought his father first, and asked, ""Father, how are babies made?"" His father""s eyes widened for a fraction, his lips pressed in a thin line as he replied tersely, ""Go ask your mother."" Which he did. But his mother had just laughed and ruffled his hair, ""Oh, Itachi, you""re too young for that!"" His mother and father would not tell him and so Itachi went to his godfather next.

""Because Minato""s going to have a younger brother soon and I want to have one too,"" the young boy replied seriously. ""Really now?"" Kakashi replied as he regarded the boy for a moment. With a deep sigh, he stood up and retrieved an orange book and a green book from his book shelf. He handed them to Itachi, ""Give these to your father and mother. Then you""ll have a baby brother-or sister-soon."" Itachi eyed the books suspiciously. ""Mother said these are bad books."" ""Bad books for children like you,"" Kakashi replied easily.

The young Uchiha still did not look convinced, ""Are you sure, Uncle Kakashi?"" ""Positive,"" the white-haired ninja replied with a thumbs-up. Itachi did what his godfather asked him to.

After the flashbacks, Kludd is starting to have second thoughts about killing Soren. Nyra growled impatiently and asked, ""What are you waiting for? Kill him!"" ""Kludd...there is one last word I will say."" Kludd blinked two times as he looked into Soren""s face and Soren tells him, ""If I made you feel that way...I""m sorry."" One lone tear fell down on Kludd""s face and lowers his talons down on the ground and Nyra sees this and she grew shocked and outraged. ""I can""t do this."" Nyra flies directly towards him and bashed him on the head.",1276465
284,"Tsuzuki slipped his hand in Hisoka""s when he noticed the man frozen in place. The sudden touch didn""t shock Hisoka; instead it seeped in some of Tsuzuki""s current confidence and strength to mingle with his own insecurities. The point of today""s exercise was to walk around, in low populated areas to start with without letting the world""s problems overload his mind. The last time it had happened, they were in the bedroom and the furniture around him practically shattered and splintered into pieces. Even Tsuzuki felt the waves of energy his partner emitted yet in the end, it turned out positively. This day seemed to mark the first time in which Hisoka would start to favor a connection with Tsuzuki instead of the environment surrounding him. At first, everything had been going well. Although Hisoka""s unyieldingly hard grasp on Tsuzuki""s hand was, so say the least, somewhat uncomfortable, Tsuzuki would never mention it out loud. Maybe he was masochistic, or too deeply in love but if he had to endure pain for the sake of Hisoka, then so be it. Although his area was the lower class section of the town, most of the inhabitants around during midday were street-sleeping, money-less, grim-covered beggars. In this particular case, since Tsuzuki scouted the area ahead of time, the people around here seemed pretty harmless. Although half of Tsuzuki""s attention seemed to be lost in thoughts, a part of his mind never wandered from the immediate surroundings. Watching, studying, and waiting to protect his lover at a moment""s notice. Besides that, Hisoka was unusually quiet - and although he wasn""t particularly talkative to begin with, this silence seemed unusually tense. Bright green eyes darted constantly around, scared but somehow, a hidden strength remained behind that fear. Since the area was relatively calm and desolate, getting used to being outside among civilization again would take time. It wasn""t enough to try and get rid of the fear of other people, but that person also needed to be comfortable in his surroundings. Once the city buildings and shops were familiar, adding more obstacles and trials would be the most emotionally draining. Plus, Tsuzuki was afraid he would be more worried than Hisoka, and if his partner picked up on that in the middle of a crowd the consequences would be hard to explain to their boss. Even with his condition, someone had to be paid to clean up any messes made in the human world. Exactly one week has passed by since Hisoka""s first outing, and Tsuzuki wasn""t entirely confident about the progress on what Hisoka could do, and what he wanted to do. Since being rehabilitated into the outside world, he started coming out of the hold he created, started becoming ""himself"" once more. Even if this entire thing worked, in the back of Tsuzuki""s mind, he knew Hisoka would never, truly recover from this incident. The past couple of nights, Hisoka""s dreams were starting to shift towards involving Murata in some way which worried him extremely.",583994
2619,"He leans heavily on me, his arms around me, as if even now, so close to death - or regeneration - he wants to be as close to me as he can. In the TARDIS Donna is babbling about medicine, Jack is shouting orders. I don""t care. I""m on my knees beside him once again, once again holding him, stroking his hair, his face. ""You can""t die, not now,"" I implore him. ""I came all this way!"" He turns to look at me, and there""s so much in this look, all those things left unsaid. He""s in great pain, but at the same time I know he""s overjoyed to see me. How long I""ve waited for that look in his eyes. Someone - Jack - is tugging at my jacket, urging me to step back, but I refuse to leave his side, refuse to let go, to take my hands off him. He looks at me again and then turns to look at his hand, which starts glowing in that eerily gold light. ""It""s starting,"" he gasps. I""m crying, tears dripping on his chest, and this time I let Jack pull me back. Donna is asking what is going on. Her face is haunted and scared, and I find my voice again, long enough to explain to her what""s happening. Jack has me gripped tightly, keeping me from rushing back to the Doctor""s side, and when the Doctor suddenly gets jerked upright, throws his head back and manages to say, ""I""m regenerating! "", I give up. Sobbing, I bury my head in Jack""s chest. He has one arm around me and the other around Donna, a protective gesture that does so little against the horror I""m feeling. The intense gold light is penetrating my closely shut eyes, so I open them again, trying to see through that blaze, trying to see what will become of the Doctor. My Doctor. In the TARDIS - later When the Doctor finally gets done explaining what happened during that regeneration, we all fall silent. I""m still standing beside Jack, but now the Doctor is looking straight at me, only me, and the shine is back in his eyes. I step forward, almost shy now. Jack""s arms slides away from my shoulders, and I can feel him step back, turning to Donna, giving me and the Doctor the moment we both so desperately waited for. My whole body is shaking when I finally reach him, and for a split second, I hesitate, but then he makes a move, and so do I, and then I""m lying in his arms. My heart is racing against his two, and I wrap my arms around him as if I never want to let him go again, and the truth is that I really don""t. My head is buried in his shoulder, taking in that familiar scent of him, his messy hair brushing the side of my cheek. He hugs me back with all he has, enfolding me completely in his arms, and somehow I know that he""s thinking exactly the same. I don""t know how long we were standing there, it felt like too long and too short at the same time. How can you make up for two years of separation in just one embrace? All those lost moments, those unsaid words that won""t come to us even now? We""re both speechless and silent, completely absorbed by the mere fact of seeing each other again. Eventually, someone taps on my back, lightly at first, then harder.",240213
3483,"""I""m fine. But I might as well get some rest before I wake up tomorrow for that meeting with the board bigwigs on the project""s continued funding and lab testing."" ""Then I guess you""d better turn in for the night, after you eat something."" Dana reminded the scientist. Max frowned. ""Seriously?"" ""I picked up some Chinese food on the way back. Low mein, stirred fried veggies, white rice, tofu fried rice, and orange chicken."" Dana told her. Max let herself into her apartment and sighed as she set her purse on the table by the door and closed the door behind her. ""I""m home..."" she called into the darkened place. Silence greeted her and she sighed, padding closer in. She stripped off her white lab coat and threw it over her couch back. She grabbed a new bottle of body wash and made her way into the shower, murmuring under her breath. ""See? It""s just an apartment..."" she muttered to herself, shaking her head as she stripped down and climbed into her shower. As she scrubbed her skin, she hummed an old song from her childhood. A noise suddenly caught her attention and she strained to hear over the running water. When she heard nothing, she went back to lathering up. The noise, like the shuffling of feet, came again. She reached out and snagged a towel, letting the shower run. Retrieving her safety baton from under the sink, she silently tiptoed from the bathroom. The shuffling came from her kitchen-living-room area and she frowned. She""d closed her door and locked it. She knew she had. The shuffling moved closer and she gripped her baton tighter. She crept closer to the mouth of the hall, breathing shallow and measured. Finally, she rushed forward and took a swing at the dark figure in her living room. She caught the intruder off-guard but was quickly repulsed by something. She hissed out a breath as lights danced behind her eyelids. The front door of her apartment opened and she briefly caught a glimpse of a svelte figure, backlit by the hallway lights. Max gasped and then the figure was gone. She stayed like that for moments, before she pushed to her feet and called for the police. In short order, she called Dana. ""Dana...can I stay over again tonight?"" AK: So...R&R, please! Lexi grit her teeth as she willed herself to walk past the brooding, uniformed jerk at the bottom of the steps. ""Hey, Lex,"" Julie grinned as she finally caught up to her best friend. ""Why""d you stop?"" Her eyes finally landed on the figure Lexi was trying to vaporize with her eyes. ""Oh."" Lexi sighed. ""Let""s go, I have to be at that interview by six. Maybe if I ignore him, he""ll take a hint."" Apparently he couldn""t take a hint. As Julie and Lexi came down the stairs, Vance Colter Junior stepped into their path. Without looking up, Lexi said, ""Move."" ""That""s a whole lotta bite, McGinnis."" Junior sneered down at her. ""And that""s a whole lotta hair gel, Junior."" Lexi dragged his name out. She smirked as his left eye twitched in annoyance. ""I want to talk to you."" Junior stated. ""Alone."" He pointedly looked at Julie.",3439302
1847,"The person who answered my question was none other than Yuki, and she spoke in her autonomous voice. ""The omniverse. It is classified as the total ensemble of all universes and realities of existence. It is larger than even the Integration Data Entity can calculate. As of yet; it is known that some of the universes that are assumed to be spatially close to our contain life forms that are vastly different in their minds and anatomical structures. But it is a fact that they are a product of Suzumiya-san""s data manipulation."" Well, that answered a few questions. I had prevented the worst from happening, all because I did something in a dream world that prevented me from being forced into partaking in a teenage fantasy. And now I was being told that Haruhi was not only the center of the world and the universe; but that she was the center of every universe that ever existed. I didn""t even know that. ""There is something of particular interest I have realized Kyon."" Itsuki said to me, his voice serious but the smile still pasted on his face. ""What is it? More problems waiting to happen..."" ""No. Have you ever heard of a thought experiment by the name of Schrödinger""s cat?"" ""Not even remotely."" I responded, beginning to become bored out of my mind. ""Let me explain. The experiment places a cat inside a box, with a possibly radioactive substance and a Geiger counter; along with a flask of poison. If the Geiger counter detects any radiation, the flask will break, releasing the poison into the box and killing the cat."" ""And how does any of this relate to Suzumiya-san?"" I said, sighing as I held myself up straight to prevent myself from falling asleep. ""If we open the box, we find that the cat is either dead or alive. But if the box remains closed; then the cat remains to be simultaneously alive and dead. It only takes the human opening the box to see the outcome of the cat""s fate; otherwise, the fate of the cat remains skewed in a quantum sense."" ""Still avoiding my question."" I mentioned as I half-listened. ""It""s simple. Whatever you did; you prevented the creation of a new universe; as well as the destruction of the universe. It is just interesting to note that somewhere in the infinity of the universe; there is a possibility that you never prevented it, and it occurs anyway. Essentially; there could even be more than one Suzumiya-san out there. But I have a feeling ours is the one who is truly God; whether she knows it or not."" Itsuki told me, and I processed most of the information he had given me. Unfortunately, there was a slight problem. ""Yeah...about not telling her...."" I said nervously, scratching the back of my head. All three, even Yuki, looked at me like I was guilty of a heinous crime, but Itsuki smiled at me; breaking their stares. ""I doubt she believed you. Suzumiya-san may want nothing less than the extraordinary; but she still has a sense of rational thought. And concerning wherever you may have seen her might have just been some sort of dream, or even her thoughts; makes less of a chance she""ll find what you told her credible.""",967934
1313,"We conversed for a little while until I heard the doorknob turn. I texted Matt back real quickly before I turned off my phone and looked up at the doctor. He was frowning as he continued to look at some x-rays. ""So Doc, do I get the stitches out today,"" I smiled happily over at him. He jumped when he heard my voice however he nodded and then replied, ""Yeah, we""ll be taking them out today, but that""s not why I made this appointment Miss. Phillips."" ""Well why did you,"" I asked politely as I could. The doctor walked over to the light board and set the x-rays up on it. He turned on the light and then turned back to me. ""Well, Miss Phillips, when the Campbells brought you in we took a few x-rays while you were passed out to assess the damage you had. At first when I was looking at these x-rays I thought maybe you just had a concussion, a blood clot maybe, but when I looked closer my nurses"" fears were confirmed. Miss Phillips does cancer run through your family,"" the doctor asked. I nodded my head and answered, ""Yeah, my great grandmother on my mom""s side has had it, my mom""s mother has had it, my mom""s father has had it, even my grandpa on my dad""s side has had it. It has ran through our family as long as I can remember. All of them recovered though."" ""That""s what I feared when I read it in your file that your family doctor faxed up to me. Miss Phillips, when we were looking at the x-ray""s we found a tumor. A small tumor, but all the same it was a tumor. Like I said before, we thought it had been because you hit your head, but when we looked closer the size and shape, was too unusual to be a blood clot or anything else,"" the doctor frowned finally meeting my eyes as he sat down in a chair. I felt my heart sink to my stomach and my breakfast about come back up. ""I have cancer,"" I asked covering my mouth with my hand as I felt tears well up in my eyes. ""Yes, but it""s treatable. We don""t know the extent of it though. We""ll know when we do the surgery..."" ""Whoa, whoa, SURGERY,"" I shouted looking up at him. ""Well yes, you""ll have to have surgery so that we can remove it, and asses how bad it is. For all we know it could have spread by now. Have you been having any headaches lately, or before you hit your head,"" the doctor asked looking over at me closely. I took a moment to think about it. I had been having frequent headaches lately, even before I hit my head. I thought it was just normal. I was prescribed glasses, but I rarely wore them unless I was reading or driving so I thought maybe that was why I had been having headaches, however, after hearing this, that thought flew out of my head. Eventually I nodded my head to his question. He wrote something down on his clipboard before looking back up when I cleared my throat, ""Um, I won""t have to have chemo will I."" That""s one thing I hated about the idea of cancer. That""s the one thing I hated watching Matt go through. That""s what made the cancer unbearable for people. I knew the moment I""d start it, I""d lose my hair, the one thing Matt loved.",806976
932,"The man politely held out the chair for his table mate, a woman with long black hair dressed in a navy-blue pants suit, before claiming his own seat. He was powerfully built, with wide shoulders and plenty of height, and she could easily imagine him intimidating anyone as he made cutthroat business deals. The couple""s body language wasn""t right for this to be a date; the man wasn""t trying to sneak any sly touches, and the woman was brisk in her movement, not flirtatious. Both of them declined wine, instead asking for virgin drinks since this was a luncheon. The woman made a point of requesting a duplicate receipt ""for business purposes"" as they ordered just appetizers and entrees, skipping the other usual courses. ""We need to be back to the office by four if we""re going to meet our lawyers,"" the man pointed out. Meiko thought it was weird to be closing a deal on Sunday, but knew that some businesses worked weird hours. She smiled as she took the order back to the kitchen, pausing as she glanced back at the couple. On the surface, they were exactly what they appeared to be, but she hadn""t missed the inadvertent way the man""s voice had softened as he spoke to the woman, or the way the woman was careful not to look any longer than appropriate at her dining companion. They each held themselves stiffly, but not in the usual manner of business professionals. Instead, their stiffness seemed to be derived from fighting an unwanted attraction. Nanako was in the kitchen again, polishing silverware (as Meiko had been saved from doing it). ""Everything going alright? You look thoughtful."" ""There""s a pair out there that are... curious,"" Meiko said. Grinning, she held up her little finger as Nanako had done a month ago. ""They want to be, but..."" she paused. ""Never let it be said that the Japanese don""t have perfect work ethics."" Nanako looked at Meiko""s pinkie, before chortling. ""Like the boy and that man last month?"" ""Much less fulfilled,"" Meiko said, before stopping. Something about the memory of the bishounen and his would-be lover struck her then. And like a jigsaw, it all fell together. ""Every two weeks,"" she said softly. ""Every two weeks."" To her credit, Nanako didn""t play stupid. ""They""ve been doing this for years,"" she said. ""The staff just plays along, since they""re such excellent customers. Whenever we get a new waitress, they""re seated in her section so the act is a bit more natural. You caught on pretty quick - it took me four months to figure it out."" ""Who are they?"" Meiko demanded. The whole idea of dressing up and acting at a restaurant, without an audience, struck her as a bit insane. ""I promised I wouldn""t tell,"" Nanako said piously, before offering a wink. ""Though I might confirm if you guess right."" Meiko allowed herself to scowl, but really was intrigued by the challenge. She thoughtfully twisted a strand from her ponytail around her finger as she thought on the situation. Nanako expected her to know who they were, which meant they were likely famous.",1112924

Shampoo then sees Ranma and then she says, ""You look familiar to Shampoo (puts hand on Ranma""s chest) Man!"" Akane whispers to Ranma ""So she""s never seen you in boy form before?""

When Shampoo comes to, Ranma then gets kissed by her, this time she says, ""You I love!"" Ranma is shocked by this but Akane had it worse, she seems maddened by this until Shampoo pulls out a booklet and then Kasumi grabs it and reads, ""Chinese Amazon laws: If a if a female Amazon is defeated by a female outsider, she must give the outsider the ""Kiss of Death"", hunt her down to the ends of the Earth, and kill her. But if a female Amazon is defeated by a male outsider, then the amazon must make him her husband."" Akane then says, ""O...k... and how can you read Chinese Kasumi?"" Kasumi then says, ""Simple, the booklet has translations!"" Akane seems shocked by this and then Shampoo sees Akane and then pounces on her and it breaks a window. Ranma and Kasumi then go up to Akane who seems ok, but Akane then says, ""I feel so refreshed... and who are you, Kasumi? What are you doing here?"" Ranma couldn""t believe Akane seems to have forgotten everything about him.",910821
2084,"Before Anastasia was allowed to leave, they had to X-ray her ribs and give her a sling for her arm. Willy had to carry the baby because Anastasia didn""t want to risk dropping her. When they arrived back at the factory, there was a great uproar. Apparently, the whole world had found out about Willy Wonka""s pregnant girlfriend and there was a torrent of camera flashes when they reached the factory. Willy and Anastasia pushed their way through the crowd and hurried through the gates. ""Just when I thought I""d get some peace and quiet."" Anastasia muttered, chucking a snowball at a nosy reporter. The snowball exploded all over his camera and stuck to his face. She let out a slightly evil-sounding laugh and they went inside. Anastasia was delighted to learn that Willy had purchased a crib and everything else needed for the baby and a room had been redecorated for her. ""I also found this, remembering what you named her."" Willy said, giving Anastasia a small box. Anastasia opened it. Inside there was a beautiful red dress with gold roses embroidered richly into it. The sleeves had lace, and so did the hem of the skirt. Anastasia slipped off the romper that the baby was currently wearing and put it on her. She wouldn""t be able to wear it until she was a little older, but it looked beautiful just the same. Anastasia""s arms were around Willy the second she had changed Rose""s clothes and placed her in the crib for a nap. Willy kissed her again. She deepened the kiss and ran her fingers through his hair. It was storming loudly outside, but that was nothing compared to what Willy felt. He pulled her closer, needing...something. He was uncertain of why he felt it was necessary to press flat against her. Without thinking, he guided Anastasia through the door and closed it behind her. He ran his hands down her body, vaguely wondering what made him do it. He half expected Anastasia to make him stop, but Anastasia didn""t. Anastasia, was in fact, doing it to him, too. He lowered her to the bed, taking care not to hurt her ribs. He felt a sharp awareness of just how close they were and where they were touching. What was happening? A bolt of thunder crashed loudly outside and the room was lost in a blinding flash of light. But that wasn""t the only thing that happened. All around Willy, inside and out, some strange explosion had taken place. A cry of surprise rushed from his throat and his head was thrown back. What felt like a major electrical shock surged through his body. Anastasia also let out a gasp, then suddenly, the power went out. Willy suddenly realized he was laying on top of Anastasia. The cold air chilled his skin, and he turned scarlet when he realized that his clothes, along with Anastasia""s, were in a pile beside the bed. His and Anastasia""s hearts were pounding against each other, and he and Anastasia were breathing so hard that it made it even more obvious how much they were touching. Willy didn""t realize what had just happened until then. Anastasia opened her eyes and looked up at him. Her face was flushed, her hair fanned out across the pillows.",870118

So- so if Marty""s parents don""t go-"" ""-Then your parents will never meet,"" Doc finished in a whisper. ""Great Scott. This is worse than I thought."" He turned to the two of them. ""Which one of you is older?"" Marty raised his hand. ""By how much?"" ""Two months."" ""You two are born so close together that you will both start disappearing at the same time if your parents don""t meet,"" Doc told them, his eyes wide. ""Marty will start first, naturally, but Elle will start only moments after."" ""Oh my God,"" Elle said, her face pale. ""Sounds heavy,"" Marty agreed. ""Weight has nothing to do with it,"" Doc said, confused. The bell rang, and immediately the halls filled with young bobbysoxers laughing and chatting, without a care in the world. Elle had almost forgotten what that had felt like. Doc bent down next to them. ""Do any of you see your parents?"" It was Marty""s turn to pale as he pointed at a boy getting getting kicked and bullied down the hallway. ""That""s him."" ""...and my dad,"" Elle muttered. George Mcfly and Daniel Phelan were walking down the corridor carrying what looked like their entire libraries in their arms. It didn""t help that a couple of jerks kept on kicking and hitting them from behind. Elle felt a rush of overprotection for her father and she damn near interfered, but Doc""s admonition rang through her mind. She stood by and watched helplessly as their fathers were walked on like they were doormats. ""Okay. Okay, you guys,"" George said. He got kicked again and laughed sarcastically. ""Very funny."" He turned around and Elle saw he had a ""KICK ME"" sign on his back with an arrow pointing at his butt. ""You guys are being real mature."" Daniel also turned around. He, too, had a ""KICK ME"" sign, but it was accompanied with an ""I""M WITH STUPID"" with an arrow pointing left- to George. ""Really, you guys, this is getting old, we don""t like it anymore-"" ""Maybe you were adopted,"" Doc said. ""Mcfly, Phelan!"" someone barked.

I said I would follow you but even my knowledge as the Great Sage can""t help us now."" Murata followed slightly behind Yuuri as they walked along the lake side. This was also the place where the main headquarters for Earth""s ""king"" (Shin Makoku counterpart) resided. As a multi story building with office style windows facing almost the entirety of the builds outer walls, it looked more then out of place in this secluded mountain area. Yuuri had come here under the guise of a friendly visit, hoping to learn more about their current situation to plan the next steps for his future. Right now, his plans; no one suspected them yet. No one really knew them anymore so they were unsure how to act around them. Conversations were usually awkward and nothing more than meaningless small talk. Yuuri casually finished off his beer as they headed towards the dock. Murata didn""t want any, but he was already on a second pack of cigarettes. He had started with a little over half a box three hours ago. Needless to say, the trip here was too long. A huge wooden box sat solemnly by itself near the frenzied tide waters. The sky grew darker and stormier the longer the box sat alone. They needed to wait until the right time, for this would be their only shot at getting back ""home"". Earth was no longer a friendly refuge like in the past. Those days were long gone; people grow up and grow apart. Yuuri""s mother flashed through his mind as he stared in quiet at the box. ""I""m sorry, mom. I never did say goodbye."" ""Weren""t you a bona fide mother""s boy? She loves you a lot, you know."" Murata said, intentionally blowing smoke into Yuuri""s face. ""You left without saying anything, even if that was a week or so ago, she""s probably worried sick."" Yuuri couldn""t hear sympathy in Murata""s voice. If that were the case, then sarcasm would be the only answer. ""You know we haven""t seen eye to eye at all these past few months. I don""t need her; let her baby someone else for a while. I""m sick of it, sick of all the fuss she nags about all the damn time. And- ARGH!"" he screamed suddenly. ""Quit blowing smoke in my face while I""m talking. Either you stop smoking, or give me one."" ""Sorry, I""m out."" He replied instantly. ""Bastard."" Yuuri""s replied. He sighed; knowing now was no longer the time for regrets and sentimental memories. ""Everything will be okay once we""re back home. We can stop fooling around; stop taking drugs and getting that addicting, expensive high. We can be like how we were, and Wolfram... he""s waiting for me. Probably worried sick too."" ""Yuuri,"" Murata spoke, this time with a caring undertone. ""We can never turn back time. The people we""ve become... we won""t escape this trap so easily. Trust me."" ""So much time has passed, old friend. And I have... a very bad feeling about this-"" he stopped midsentence.

As if the heavens had heard his prayer, she answered (was it coincidence? had she read his mind? was his embarrassment clearly painted on his face?) the question. ""Since we""re heading in the same direction, I thought we could walk together."" She smiled, and he felt that same fluttering in his chest. Wait- since when did that word exist in his vocabulary? ""I hope you don""t mind."" What was he supposed to answer to that? It wasn""t like he despised her presence, on the contrary- wait, there was no ""on the contrary"", he considered his solitude perfectly fine, and that was it. It wasn""t like this girl-grumble- His train of thoughts halted when he heard a low grumbling sound. Flicking his eyes to the side, he saw Hino stop, her cheeks flaming in embarrassment. Judging from her hand on her stomach, the source of that sound could only be- ""I""m sorry!"" and she laughed timidly. ""I seem to be quite hungry."" Quite hungry- yes, that was the understatement of the year! He, of all people, should know that she did not eat lunch because of her Math assignment and the continuous practice for the concert. He could feel irritation building. This girl was not only Accident Prone; she was a Walking Accident Zone. ""No worries though!"" she rummaged her bag and retrieved a small pack. ""I have snacks."" She opened the pack and took one of the partly chocolate-covered stick biscuit before offering him. ""Want some Pocky?"" ""Pocky?"" he repeated as he watch her bite the tip of the stick but not enough to break it with her teeth. ""Yes- don""t tell me you haven""t eaten Pocky in your life,"" she said jokingly which made him feel defensive. ""It""s not like it""s popular or anything."" She stopped walking and looked at him wide-eyed. ""Not popular..? Why, Tsukimori-kun, Pocky is the universal snack of all time!"" She offered him again. ""Here, have some. You""d definitely love it."" He shook his head and was slightly annoyed in the underlying pity in her tone. So, what if he preferred butter cookies and had not eaten Pocky in his life? Butter cookies sufficed as, and to quote her, ""the universal snack of all time.' Thinking that he refused because his uninjured arm was holding his bag, she grabbed it and replaced it with a Pocky stick just as he protested. ""Here- and you can""t return that, you know,"" she added when he attempted to. ""Come on, Tsukimori-kun,"" she peered at his bowed head, his eyes focused on the Pocky stick. ""It""s not poisoned or anything."" ""How ungrateful of you if you actually attempted that, Hino,"" he said and Kahoko blinked- was Tsukimori-kun trying to be humorous..? He certainly did not say that in a nasty tone, more like it was in an almost joking tone. ""Not bad."" She blinked again and noticed that he had taken a bite from the Pocky stick. He stared at the stick critically before taking another bite.",560480
639,"The Heart tree was no weirwood - it lacked the white bark and bloody red-pink leaves my mother told me about - but it took larger and taller than any of the others. It seemed like it had five trunks, all reaching for the sky like fingers, coming together in the center just above the ground, leaving what looked like a seat where they met. A brook - artificially carved or natural, I couldn""t tell, wove between the bushes and wrapped around one side of the Heart tree. So that was where I sat, swathed in the impenetrable shade of the three and nestled by it""s large trunks. I don""t know how long I sat there, but the orange of the sky gave way to deep reds and purples, some even darker blues that filtered through the leaves. It was there that I saw the beast Bronn talked about. It stood, tall and regal, just to my left. I hadn""t heard it approach, and it merely stared at me with unnervingly intelligent red eyes. It did growl and it didn""t approach. I could feel it wasn""t angry or scared. Merely curious, as if to ask ""Who are you? What are you doing here?' So, ignoring Bronn""s earlier advice, I reached a hand out to the direwolf, ""I""m safe, boy."" It""s eyes slid to my hand, then back to my face. After a long silent moment the wolf took a step forward, then again stared at my hand. I could feel it""s weariness. ""I""m just as confused by this place as you are by my presence,"" I smiled, careful to show no teeth, ""Come here and see, if you don""t believe me."" And the wolf did, walking over to sniff at my outstretched hand. After a moment of regarding my face and hand with a tilted head, the wolf pushed at my arm with it""s nose and sat down. The weariness was still there in it, but much less so. I took this as a good sign and ran my hand through the fur at it""s back. It looked back up at me for a moment, huffed, and laid down at my feet. I giggled and resumed my patting. It just wanted to be pet. ""How do you like it here, boy?"" I asked. It looked back up me with a look that screamed boredom. When I scratched behind it""s ears, it rested it""s hand against it""s paws. ""Well, I hope it""s a bit better for me than that,"" I smiled sadly, and looked to the side at my reflection in the brook, ""A little scared here... well, a lot scared. Everything is new and it""s only been a day but I-"" The direwolf shot up. I started as it ran off, jumping clear over the brook and to one of the other entrances to the Godswood. A man stood there, staring right at me as the direwolf went to it""s side. As it stared at the man, I could feel happiness. From the direwolf Bronn said the King owned. He wore no crown, so I assumed he was someone close to the King. He was dressed far too well for a guard, though wore a dark gambeson and had a sword at his side. The only thing I could think was ""I""m in so much trouble.' ""Who are you?"" The man asked, looking from me to the wolf, ""Ghost doesn""t usually warm up to people so quickly."" ""I... I am Synne,"" I gulped, using the tree as emotional as well as physical support to lift myself up and brush my dress off, ""Synne, um... Sand.""",748687
237,"He wanted to tell her that she looked like Hell anyway because all of her ribs were sticking out and what was she so worried about? The world had better problems to deal with than her issues. But, he couldn""t. Yorke was watching. After finally giving her the drink she wanted and feeling his blood pressure boil, he was putting the lid on when Blaze appeared at the counter. He passed the girl her cup and she walked off in a huff. Turquoise eyes hardened by loss and time met icy steel-blue eyes. Blackheart could have sworn that time absolutely stopped in that moment. He could have also sworn that his heart stopped beating for a moment. ""You look familiar,"" Blaze commented, ""do I know you?"" Blackheart shook his head. Ordinarily, he would have hurled a load of insults at Blaze, but he was a little terrified at the thought of fighting him with no powers. He struggled to think of a nice white lie that would throw Blaze off of his trail, but he didn""t have to. Blaze merely dropped the money on the counter and left. Blackheart let out a breath that he hadn""t even realized that he""d been holding. Sweat had popped out on his forehead and his legs suddenly felt like water. ""What""s going on?"" He jumped. Dawn was right beside him, having seemingly come out of nowhere. ""Don""t do that,"" he snapped as he put the money in the drawer, ""it""s never a good idea to sneak up on me."" Dawn""s impish grin got on his nerves. ""Don""t you have some tables to clear?"" he asked irritably. ""Touchy,"" Dawn mumbled, walking away. He watched her. After that encounter with Blaze, she was walking differently. Her back was straighter and her head wasn""t drooping so much. It made him want to throw up. Closing time cannot possibly come fast enough, he thought. Chapter 6 Chapter 6 A/N: Sorry for such a long pause. Blame it on class, homework, writer""s block, and illness all at one time. Hope it was worth the wait! Chapter 6 Blackheart arrived at his new apartment just as night was beginning to fall. The first thing he did was step in the shower and scrub the coffee smell off as best as he could. The old sheets had been tossed out and new ones put on the bed, so it was definitely more inviting. He spent a couple of hours going through more stuff that he""d decided to get rid of, then flopped face-first into it. It felt good to not hear the noise of the restaurant anywhere around him and his eyes didn""t take long to close. But her face lingered there in his mind""s eye, like it had since the day he""d first met her. He was too tired to even groan, so he let sleep sweep him away into a dream. Dawn was sitting on a park bench, Squishie at her side as usual. Her belly had grown huge over the months, adding to her curvaceous figure. She had her chin resting in one hand, looking very lost. Curious as to what she was thinking about, he came closer. ""What am I going to do now? My life is over before it started,"" Dawn sighed, ""I""ve finished school, but no one""s going to hire a single mother. My job at the coffee shop isn""t going to support both of us."" He didn""t know what to say.",870118
552,"It was all on the ground before him in a great, smelly puddle of ooze and bad bile. Edward began to dry wretch as another wave of nausea hit him. More vomiting commenced until his body had finally purged itself of all the bad poisons from the reckless weekend. As he continued to puke up his guts, Edward felt hollow. He was hungry, tired and in mourning. He was honestly regretting his licentious behaviour. Even Peter was going to regret it sooner or later and that man couldn""t even spell ""regret."" As he lay pathetic and weak, Edward could feel the vomit start to trickle against his knees. Yet he felt something in his stomach; not nausea but a sense of foreboding. He was being watched. Edward turned round and started to scan. Yes, he could feel it in his animal brain that someone or something was watching him. ""Whose there?"" he called out in a voice that was devoid of the confidence that had been his trademark. No answer came, yet from the fathomless shadows there was a sound, like a rustling of cloth or a man shifting his weight. Yes, there was most certainly something there. ""Who are you?"" he asked, come out. Just for the smallest moment Edward was worried that some madman or wild animal was waiting to pounce on him. The silence was killer; he knew not what to expect. He certainly didn""t expect a voice from the dead to ring out. ""Edward,"" came that one word, from the voice of a man who""d been dead for two years; a man who""d broken through Edward""s protective shell and brought out a fine, kind man to the world. Edward looked up as if he""d seen a ghost. There was no way that voice could be real. It must be a side effect of the drugs; it had to be. ""No,"" Edward whispered as he knelt before a pool of vomit. ""You died,"" he breathed. Moisture started to cloud Edward""s vision and he clenched his fists hard enough to draw blood with is nails. ""I let you fall."" Regret was etched into every fibre of his being like a permanent, painful tattoo. He looked up and a new emotion entered his voice that had not been present in a long time, hope. ""Is that you?"" he hardly dared to ask, as if just by asking the whole thing would vanish in a puff of smoke. Behind Edward, only a few moths flying around the outside light on the back of the house bore witness to these events. Peter was still inside cleaning up used condoms and enjoying it more than anyone should have the right to. No reply came and Edward spoke a little more forcefully. ""Please, I need to know that it""s you,"" he began to plead, ""I need to know that I""m not just losing my mind."" There was hesitation from the shadows but in the end an answer would not be denied, ""It""s me, Edward."" A hurricane of emotions spun through Edward, threatening to cause a meltdown just like three days ago at the breakfast table and the cheese story. ""How can it be you?"" Edward""s voice was so quiet. ""I thought you were . . . I thought . . . ""the sentence was too horrible to finish. His lower lip quivered as he finally finished that unspeakable sentence, ""I thought you died."" More hesitation came from the shadows.",1220273
1746,"He hated seeing Germany like this. We all did. When he settled down, Austria looked back at Switzerland, carefully avoiding looking down at Germany, ""... I..."" He looked away again, ""How do you even know England vill help us? He""s not exactly a fan of Germany, or either of us for that matter."" ""Because I""ll make him!"" Italy said with conviction. He squeezed my hand again, and tore his eyes from Germany to look at Austria, ""I""m part of the Alliance, so I""ve got the power to help Germany once we get there!"" ""Feliciano..."" Austria looked down at the Italian with a sad look. The three of us knew just how far Italy would go to help Germany. If we didn""t help him, Italy would probably try to take Germany by himself, which would get them both killed or caught by the Empire. And unlike Germany, Switzerland, and I... Italy wasn""t immune to the effects of Insanity. Wait a minute. ""Switzerland..."" My brow furrowed, and I looked away from Italy to the other nation, ""... why are you and Germany immune like me?"" Switzerland stopped checking over Germany to look across the bed at me, ""I vas vondering vhen you""s ask that."" He sighed and leaned again a crate next to the bed. Switzerland crossed his arms and closed his eyes for a moment before speaking, ""I don""t really understand it either. Germany told me shortly after I came that my past neutrality caused me to build an immunity to the Insanity. I was around him, France, and so many other nations that entered Insanity so many times over the years, in varying degrees and forms, that eventually I grew immune to its influence."" Switzerland opened his eyes and fixed them on Germany""s sleeping form, ""My history of neutrality makes me immune. Germany... he""s immunity is only temporary. World War II was so great, and his Insanity to terrible then, that he still has the barriers and the memory of it, as well as trying to preserve his memory so he doesn""t forget. Vonce those memories fade, he""ll become just as susceptible as Italy or Austria. Russia, on the other hand..."" Switzerland grimaced, ""He""s in a state of his own permanent Insanity, so he can""t be infected by France""s. And you, of course, are too small of a nation to worry about ever getting it."" I nodded; that made sense to me. So much information on the Insanity that they never taught us at the Academy had been dumped on me. At World Academy W, all we were taught was that the Insanity is terrible, all the larger nations go into it, and the tiny nations like myself and the micros would not have to worry about it. The fact that nations lose the memory of their Insanity quickly after coming out of it is why. ""Switzerland... wh... what does the Insanity feel like?"" Italy spoke up again in a small voice, his eyes trained on Germany again. Of course Italy couldn""t remember his own Insanity; he wasn""t the leader, after all. Switzerland looked away, and Austria walked behind Italy, putting a hand on his shoulder. Italy jumped, but didn""t tear his gaze from Germany, ""It""s a terrible thing, Italy. Don""t think about it, or you""ll remember.",748687
2790,"Anyone involved will not only get expelled, but will get arrested as well."" Everyone was silent as soon as they played the ""Breaking News"" for the local news and one of the morning anchors had made this opening report. ""On top of the hour, we""re following some breaking news straight out of the courtroom that we""re now reading the verdicts in the case of Trevor Hindsmire over this kidnapping and torture charges brought against him. Let""s all listen in."" the morning news anchor announced. Meena looks at this image of Trevor just smirking for the cameras, seemingly confident that he""ll get a not guilty verdict and just looking at his face on the screen brought in a load of anxiety for her, but she found the strength to just not let this guy get inside her head, though he""s not physically in the school right now and just waits for the shoe to drop as soon as the verdict comes in. ""Have we all decided on a verdict?"" asked the judge. ""We have, your honor."" one verdict responds. Trevor kept on smirking in front of the whole courtroom and he""s hoping that he""ll walk free out of this jail and continue going the way he""s going, like maybe go back to school and charm other girls with his rich and wit and that his lawyers will back him up to throw out the case, proving that there""s no physical evidence of a livestreaming incident. ""Proceed."" the judge added. One of the jurors stood up and she clears her throat and said, ""We""ll focus on last week""s incident; on the charge of attempted murder, we the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant Trevor Hindsmire, guilty."" Then, Trevor""s smirk silently faded as soon as he heard his first ""guilty"" come out of her mouth and he didn""t think that it""ll go that further than that and whispered to his lawyer, ""What the hell?"" ""On the count of aggravated assault, we the jury find the defendant, Trevor Hindsmire, guilty."" the juror added. ""What?"" asked Trevor. ""On the second count of attempted aggravated assault, we the jury find the defendant, Trevor Hindsmire, guilty."" the juror kept on. For Meena, it was like she was being very vindicated and like a huge weight had lifted off of her shoulders, but still waits to see what other charged he may or may not be guilty of, but so far...it seems like Morrison was expecting this to happen. ""On the count of conspiring to commit murder with one or more party, we the jury find the defendant, Trevor Hindsmire, guilty."" the juror continued. As soon as every charge reads ""guilty"", Trevor became confused and shocked as to how his actions will be completely reprimanded and that those consequences are giving him much more direct serious approaches to have the book thrown directly at him. ""On the count of first-degree torture, we the jury in the above entitlement, find the defendant, Trevor Hindsmire, guilty."" the juror continued. ""They can""t be serious."" Trevor whispered to his attorney. ""As the the count of endangering a minor, we the jury find the defendant, Trevor Hindsmire, guilty."" the juror responded. ""Oh, they""re serious.""",1276465
922,"Archie told her it""s easier for Henry to paint people into black and white roles, and she shouldn""t do anything to destroy his fantasy. The idea that Henry could possibly be right is seductive, and she refuses to indulge his fantasy that far. If Regina really is a wicked witch, then Emma would be justified in sweeping him away. The thought of kidnapping briefly passes through her mind. It would be so, so easy to take Henry away from Storybrooke, and start a new life somewhere else. A good bounty hunter knows how to fake the papers, and Emma is convinced she could get away with it if she gets Henry to play along. She could spin the Sleeping Beauty story, maybe, and convince Henry that he""s a prince who needs to be hidden from the Evil Queen. All she has to do is get him into her car, and spin him a tale. It""s tempting, but Emma isn""t going to offer him that poisoned apple. She can""t live a lie. She knows that if she needs to, she""ll face Regina, head to head, and give her son the heroic showdown he""s clearly plotting in his fairytale-infested head. Instead, Emma sighs, and asks him if he likes salt on his popcorn. There""s no way some lawbreaking asshole is going to get the better of Emma Swan. She""s twenty-three and powerful. Bounty hunting (the politically correct term may be bail bondsman, but she knows she""s a bounty hunter) is something she lucked into, but she is very, very good at it. A former roommate of hers, a rather stupid girl from Jersey, had ended up in the business, and told her it was good money. Emma""s bounced between jobs ever since high school, and she""s never found anything she could tolerate for more than six months. But she needs to eat, so she walks up to a bail bondman""s office and offers her services. The man looks her up and down, and tosses her a book of rules she""ll need to follow. Don""t fuck up and you""ll get paid, he tells her cynically. She ends up pulling in her first bail jumper the next day. It""s like something clicks inside her. All of the jobs she""s been through have provided her with a skill set that""s flexible, and her pretty face makes people underestimate her. She""s given a task and the bail bondsman doesn""t care how she accomplishes it as long as she doesn""t piss the police off. She collects a couple of commissions and squirrels away at least thirty percent in order to build her own bank account. In less than a year, she has enough money to start putting up her own funds and becomes a bail bondsman in her own right. It""s even better, because she""s in charge of her own life and doesn""t answer to anyone. She is not unaware of how ironic it is that she finds freedom by denying others theirs. Most of the people she posts bail for end up paying her back with a small bit of commission. It""s the ones who don""t that she secretly enjoys more. There""s nothing like the thrill of the hunt. She likes taking names and pushing back, because without fail the guys who jump bond are assholes. It""s a one hundred percent guarantee, and the law is on her side when she goes to drag the assholes back.",1112924

483,"Perhaps even a reformed Olaf could be there as well. He wished the scene would come true in some not too distant future, but he knew it was unlikely to happen.

They had beaten him badly enough with that crowbar that he was fairly certain even if they hadn""t tied him up, he wouldn""t have been able to move, let alone escape. Still, he refused to give up.

Olaf held up a crowbar with the tips now freshly sharpened. Jacques didn""t understand. Then Olaf asked, ""Tell me, Snicket. Do you think this looks like a set of sharp baby""s teeth?"" Olaf then stabbed Jacques"" neck, as Esme squealed in glee. Jacques slumped as the blood poured out of him. ""Olivia,"" he said, his final word. He only hoped Kit would learn what happened to him before she came here. He would hate for his beloved sister to face off against Count Olaf. He feared she would make the same mistake he had. Remembering the man Olaf had once been, rather than the awful creature he""d become. She read as much as she could from the library the last Madam Lulu had left behind. A woman who""d left so quickly, Olivia hadn""t even caught a name before the woman rushed into the cab to drive off. Though she""d called out as she sped off, ""The disguise kit is in the back, the library in the cupboard. Use it wisely, Olivia Caliban."" Olivia had been slightly horrified by the woman""s wild driving. She most certainly wasn""t going speed limit and she made a turn without signalling. She was the VFD""s best field agent? Still, Olivia climbed the stairs of the tent. She examined everything, making a plan quickly. She disguised herself first, changing her eyes, putting on a wig and wearing far too much makeup. She looked over the results, certain that the advanced computer that had failed to catch Count Olaf would also fail to catch her. In fact, hers was much better than his had ever been. Olivia noticed the note that had been left for her. It explained the role of Madam Lulu in the wider organization of VFD. It also explained how to use the smoke and mirrors of the tent to create magic. It instructed her to learn as much as she could as quickly as she could, as a good fortune teller was merely a great librarian in disguise. It ended with a warning of the starving lions roaming around and a promise that she would return as soon as she was able to with answers and the sugar bowl. It was signed by Madam Lulu. Three people entered her tent, startling her. Olivia immediately hid the note, as she got into character. ""Who are you, please?"" They seemed just as confused at the sight of her. The good-looking man spoke, ""Are you Madam Lulu? You look like her, but not like her.",1497577
1984,"Her little arms were reaching up for him, asking him to pick her up. Then, two people appeared at the doorway. One was a tall, slender man with a black moustache and hair that looked eternally windswept. The woman had fiery ginger-colored hair that fell in tight curls. Both of them looked puzzled. Ana instinctively knew that they couldn""t see the Outsider. She blinked and the ghostly images dissipated. ""What was that?"" she asked out loud. She almost jumped out of her skin as the Outsider formed in front of her. This one was not transparent as the other had been-this one was real. ""The world has changed quite a bit since you last lived here, hasn""t it? And yet we have come full-circle."" He watched her eyes and could see the exact moment that the realization struck her. ""That baby...that little girl that sat just there...that was me..."" The slight ghost of a smile appeared on his lips. ""This is the place that we first met,"" he confirmed, ""and though you were so young that you couldn""t speak a word, you showed no fear of me whatsoever. Your parents, unfortunately, were not so open-minded. They couldn""t see me and it frightened them."" Ana looked down at the rune in her hands. ""I would imagine,"" she replied quietly, ""they looked very worried. But how did I manage to forget them? You would think I""d see them each time I looked in a mirror. Where are they now?"" ""Gone."" She didn""t like the way he said that. The word gone sounded heavy and dark even in his deep, quiet, melodic voice. There were two ways that a person could say ""gone"" and this particular tone made it a synonym for dead. ""Gone,"" she repeated blankly, ""for how long?"" ""For years,"" he replied, ""they were among the first plague victims. But the Abbey had stepped in before they had even started to cough."" Ana frowned. ""The Abbey...why?"" ""The answer to that can be found upstairs,"" he informed her. Without really thinking, she did go upstairs. Most of the belongings in this house had been taken already. Broken boards lay in doorways and beneath windows. Someone had tried to seal this place off, but looters and vagrants must have pried the boards away shortly afterward. She found a bed with the mattress laying halfway off the frame. A sickening brown stain was visible on the dirty gray blanket lying bunched up at the end. Ana cringed. She followed the dark smear across the floorboards to the stairs. Which one was it? Never mind...I don""t want to know! She turned away from the ruined bed and began to search through the dresser drawers and closet. She found nothing. The Outsider had vanished. Of course he has... She was about to give up when she tripped. Swearing nastily, she sat up and rubbed her knee. After digging a splinter out of it, she noticed that the floorboard was loose. It took a few minutes to find a fire poker, then another few minutes to force the board up enough where she could get the small metal box underneath. There was a coin pouch there, unsurprisingly empty, and a small journal. She blew the dust off of it and flipped it open to the first page.",870118
1213,"""Aw rats,"" Joegore said, ""Lost another set."" He smacked his lips, picked up Yami""s luggage, and walked inside. The door shut behind him with a loud clang, like a death knell ringing. AN: Gracious! We must be careful not to say ""Kikyo"" (lightning flash, thunder clap, horses rear, woman screams!!!) See what I mean? Please review. The housekeeper sowed them into a large hallway, with an enormous fireplace and mantle, over which hung a painting of Doctor Von Yugistein""s grandfather. The housekeeper took down an oversized candelabrum, and lit the candles. Then, she turned and led them to a long, winding staircase. ""This way to your rooms,"" she said, floating up the stairs. Yami, Serenity, and Joegore followed her, but then she spun around, nearly knocking Yami in the head with the candelabrum, and said, ""Be careful. The stair way is treacherous."" Then she turned back, and led them on up, up, up the winding staircase to a set of rooms in the second level of the castle. ""These are your rooms,"" the housekeeper said. ""I hope you""ll find them comfortable."" Serenity, reluctantly, left them and went into one room, while Joegore dropped the luggage and shuffled into another. Yami sighed, picked up his bags, and followed the housekeeper to the last door at the end of the hall. She took out a large key, and used it to unlock the door. Inside was a very large bedchamber and library. Three bookcases took up one wall, and the bed looked big enough to fit in a swimming pool. Across from the bed was another large fireplace, with another painting of Yami""s grandfather over the mantle. ""This was your grandfather""s room."" ""Quite an extensive book collection he had,"" Yami said, inspecting the books along the wall. ""Yes, he was ever the diligent scholar."" ""If this is what his bedroom is like,"" Yami said, ""I can""t wait to see what his laboratory is like."" ""His what?"" the housekeeper asked., rather nervously. ""His laboratory,"" Yami repeated. ""Surely my grandfather would have a laboratory."" ""Why that""s silly,"" she replied. ""Your grandfather""s offices, where he practiced medicine, are across town."" ""Of course,"" Yami said, ""It""s just that... well, with all the rumors, I figured he kept a small set of offices here."" ""You should know better than to believe in fairytales,"" the housekeeper said. As Yami then proceeded to unpack his belongings, she asked, ""Now, is there anything I can offer you before bed? A glass of warm milk? Ovaltine? Hot passionate sex?"" ""Uh... no thank you,"" Yami said, rather disturbed. She shrugged, and turned to leave. But as Yami got out a small mirror, he watched her reflection in the mirror. She whispered something, and kissed the painting of his grandfather. Yami turned around, just in time to see her float out the door. ""Good not, Doctor,"" she said. ""Good night, lady Kikyo,"" Yami said. Lightning flashed, thunder clapped, horses reared, a woman screamed! ""Knock it off, sis!"" Joegore shouted from his room. Act Two: Scene Two In the darkest time of night, Yami tossed and turned, his sleep invaded by dark and horrible thoughts.",512464
597,"Immediately the smell of blood lessened dramatically but the smell was still there, emanating off the red stones. Bradley""s face was an unreadable mask as he responded to some alien desire deep within him that no human could comprehend. Picking up one red stone with such delicacy as a mother handles her baby; Bradley took one of the four red stones at random and picked it up. He stared at the red stone for quite some time, how long passed Bradley did not care for he had no more appointments tonight. When he""d looked over it enough, Bradley put the stone in his mouth and began to chew. A series of harsh, crunching noises pervaded the room as Bradley munched on the red stone. His breathing grew more intense, as though something were irritating him or the flavour of the red stone was foul. Bradley chomped down on the stone with a look of intensity similar to a starving man eating a rat; he may hate the taste but there""s precious little choice. As Bradley chewed, drool began to run from the corners of his mouth. The drool was crimson, as if the red stone were bleeding. Snorting and snarling, Bradley""s tongue shot out and lapped up the blood drool as if he were suddenly enjoying the flavour. And then all of the sudden- CLANG! Bradley reached under his desk and drew a sword he kept there for just this reason. Moving faster than the eye, Bradley spun around in his chair and blocked a sword strike that would have decapitated him. His sword and the other sword met with a clang; the blades struck each other with such force that each one received a nick in it. Bradley snarled at the assassin who""d tried to strike him down. He bared his teeth like a dog, stained blood red from the red stone. Gulping uncomfortably, he swallowed the red stone with some difficulty before addressing his attacker. ""I could see the currents in the air moving because of you,"" he spoke in a low, dangerous voice just spewing with hate. ""You""re still clumsy, stupid and slow,"" he accused as the monocle fell away, revealing his ghastly ultimate eye with the oroborous on it. ""And unlike me, you have been caught twice-or is it three since you""re here now?"" Still holding their swords together, the attacker turned out to be . . . Bradley? It couldn""t have been but it was true. There standing across from Bradley at the desk was another Bradley, dressed like a Germanic king. The appearance of the other Bradley suggested he""d been out in the cold for a long time; his moustache and hair were completely frosted over. It looked like he""d run all the way from the Vatican to Finland. ""I hate you too, Pride,"" said Wrath Bradley. Unlike his twin homunculus he needed to elaborate phrases to express his feelings; they both hated each other equally. A look of revulsion crossed Wrath""s face at the realization he""d actually spoken to his twin. Getting back into contact with his brother was the last thing he wanted to do but he needed Pride""s help for what he was about to accomplish. ""How is the Rosenkruz Order?"" Wrath asked, knowing that small talk would help to inflame his twin""s considerable ego.",1220273
1601,"""So...why was asking Akito a bad idea? I thought he must know about the key since he knows about everything else in the house,"" Tohru said. ""Ah...Akito...well...he""s kind of dangerous, Miss Honda,"" Yuki said, ""do you know why Tohru wears such long bangs?"" ""No,"" she admitted. ""Because Akito blinded him in that eye."" Tohru stared. ""How?"" she asked. ""I""m assuming you""ve seen him then,"" he said, ""if you""ve gone downstairs and spoken to him. How did you find him? Didn""t Okami make you go away?"" ""No,"" Tohru said as they walked towards the garden, ""I went in at night when everyone was asleep. I heard him crying and I thought it was...well, this is going to sound silly-I thought he was a ghost! Everyone kept pretending he wasn""t real, so I had to do something. Then last night, I was going to look for this key, but I didn""t know where to start, so I went downstairs and asked."" Kyo and Yuki were looking more and more nervous by the second as she told her story. ""And he just let you have it? For nothing?"" ""He did say that I owe him a favor,"" Tohru said, ""but I don""t know what it is yet-he hasn""t decided."" ""You really screwed up, then,"" Kyo told her. ""What did he do to Hatori? Why?"" They unlocked the door with a little bit of difficulty and shoving, but the decaying gate eventually gave in and moved. ""He was angry with him for wanting to get married,"" Yuki said quietly, sounding sad, ""and...well...everyone has to do what they""re told around here. It""s part of our curse along with being turned into an animal. We can""t refuse. Akito threw a glass or something at him and hit him in the face. He keeps that eye covered up so that he won""t have to be reminded of it."" ""That""s horrible,"" Tohru said tearfully, ""I knew he could be mean, but not that mean!"" ""You don""t know anything about him,"" Kyo said bitterly, ""you only met him once."" ""Twice,"" she corrected him gently. ""I don""t want to talk about him anymore,"" Kyo said irritably, ""let""s see what""s in here that""s so damn important."" They went inside. Melody the dove flitted from treetop to treetop until she found a perch to her liking. Tohru couldn""t help but feel a tiny bit disappointed: there was a crumbling stone fountain covered in moss. There was ivy all over the walls and most of the flowerbeds were overgrown with weeds. And it appeared that every plant in them was dead. ""It""s all dead,"" she lamented. ""No,"" Yuki said, taking a pocket knife from the pocket of his coat, ""look."" He skinned a bit of bark off of a young sapling. ""It""s still alive-see the green? Everything sleeps in the winter. You must have come from further south where this doesn""t happen as much."" ""So when spring comes, this will all grow back?"" ""Yes, Miss Honda. And I""ll bet my friends will help us get it going again."" ""You are such a show-off,"" Kyo muttered. Yuki grinned maliciously. ""Am I? I""ll bet you""re saying that because you""ve never grown anything in your life-except your temper!"" ""I can SO grow something! I""ll prove it!"" Quite obviously steamed, Kyo seized a little oval-shaped thing and dug a hole with his hands.",870118
3400,"""Look at yourself now."" He blurted out in suppressed laughter, she realized she had ridden herself of the sheet. She nearly fell back the chain keeping her up, Loki snatched her wrist and pulled her back onto the bed. ""Listen. Take me home... I just want to be home."" She begged while gazing into his eyes, Loki wove his fingers through hers and held them close. His hand was cold and unwelcoming, but she didn""t mind. She realized that the cold weather was always and anything having to do with it. ""I""m afraid I can""t do that. I made the mistake of letting you go years ago. Now that I am king I plan on reuniting Midgard and Asgard with our marriage."" ""Why me though? I know I look like her, but... I don""t want this."" He growled at the pit of his throat releasing her hand and swinging up from the bed with a snap of his fingers he was fully clothed in his signature green armor with his helmet atop his head. ""You are my slave now Ava. I do what I wish with you. The servants will be in here to pick you up for dinner and perhaps another bath would due."" Ava felt herself glare at the stone cold king as he entered back across the room and exited it through the royal oak doors. She had never felt this scared in her life, she of course tried not to show it, but- At least she will be able to use her magic when the chains came off. She nodded to herself with confidence, all she needed to do was teleport and leave. That was it, just leave, perhaps this would be easier than expected. When the servants arrived she couldn""t have been more wrong, they were instructed by their Clever king to cuff her left wrist with a bracelet of sorts before releasing your ankle. It put mountains of stress on her, knowing that she""d be having dinner with the most hated man in Midgard. She tried to understand what made him even consider making amends with the human race. The dress that was chosen for her was prettier than anything she had ever worn in her life, obviously. It was thin around her waist, going down between her breasts. The sleeves finishing at her wrists and fit tightly to her arms. The skirt ended at her knees, of course it had to be green. She was led down a long corridor and urged into a room where a table stood. Food plates went up and down the table in exotic wonder, large meats and tankards, bowls of soup and salad. She had never seen so much food in her life, she assumed it was night by the way the moonlight shone in through the windows into the dining room. Ava was forced to sit down at one end of the table, on the other was a chair that appeared almost like a throne in itself, that side of the table was far more ridded of appetizers and dinner plates. The servants began shoveling foods she had never seen before onto her plate. She tried to tell them she wasn""t hungry, but the more she looked at the food, the hungrier she got. The servants left her with a plate full of chickens, green leaves, meat stew and more meat. The tankard she was given held a large quantity that of wine, something she had never tried before.",6234395
2580,"What did you do to my Yuta-chan?!"" Mito began shaking Nina. Her eyes widened after seeing Yuta""s clothes drop into the cauldron. Black smoke emerged from it. ""Er...um... what.kind.of.magic.was.that?!"" Nina asked her computer uneasily. ""Why is there a cat there?"" Ayu asked. Indeed, there was a very cute cat on top of the bundle. It had light brown fur and big brown eyes. Maya, Luna and the rest of those present in the hall looked at it curiously. ""Well, the magic basically turns the person into a cat."" Nina""s computer responded proudly. ""WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTT?!"" The people in the hall choused. ""But... why did you give me that magic!?"" Nina scolded her computer. ""Er... if Yuta-sama is a cat, then he can escape."" The computer reasoned out. ""Oh, you""re right."" Nina said thoughtfully. Mito was just frozen in the spot. She was looking at the cat. ""Hahaha...HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA!!! My brother is soooo cute when he""s a cat!"" Mito exclaimed. The others also exploded laughing. Yuta the cat growled. ""What a cutie!!!"" ""I want to have a cat like that!"" ""That""s my cat!"" ""No! That is mine!"" ""You""re both wrong. That is MY CHARLOTTE!!!"" Some girls began to fight over the cute little kitty. ""Yuta! How does it feel to be a cat!"" Rio shouted in between laughs. Yuta hissed. ""Yuta the cat! Yuta the cat! YUTA THE CAAAAAAT!"" Some people chanted. Veins appeared on Yuta-the-cat""s head. Maya looked at Yuta the cat. ""Oh well. I think we also need a cat in this potion, right?"" She asked Luna. Luna looked at the scroll. ""Yes."" Maya smirked. She got a rope from her pocket. ""Yuta!"" She called with her sweetest voice. Yuta the cat turned and was met by Maya""s rope. In a few seconds, Yuta was again tied. The laughing in the hall died out after seeing that the cute little cat was again captured. Our favorite characters began to panic again. ""This time I""ll let you know the price you""d pay for messing up with an Orihara."" Maya positioned the poor Yuta above the cauldron. She let out a diabolically evil laugh. ""I""ll count to three."" ""One..."" Yuta the cat began struggling. ""Two..."" Mito and the others were panicking as they ran towards the cauldron. ""Three..."" Maya let go of the rope. ""RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!!"" An alarm clock signaled the start of a new day. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To Be Continued... So what do you think? Please Review!!! I""m so sorry that this chapter is lame and very random. Yeah, it is full of silliness. Could you imagine how Yuta-the-cat looks like? Aw! He""s SOOO CUTE! (Hugs Yuta-the-cat) Oh yeah, this is still not the true revenge... (smirks) (1) I really love that scene! That is why I cannot allow that to be left out here in my fic.

202,"Yuuya was lively having a conversation with Ran and the other girls. Ran asks of him to buy him a drink, to, which Yuuya indulges. Both suddenly leave Rei alone. Hoo boy, Rei really had something to say when they left; something about Yuuya and his sad state of being a ""slave"" to Ran""s demands. A short sigh, and he goes back to reading his book (in the same sitting position as described in hint #1) Should I go on and find some more evidence? Stay tuned for the next Rant section! Chapter 9 Rei woke up with a start; feeling somewhat oddly cold and the familiar pressure in his chest disappear. It was starting to grow late outside, and Rei noticed one more thing: Yuuya wasn""t with him anymore. Rei grunted a bit, then proceeded to walk out of the tub, finishing the bath he intended for only an hour. The water...seemed to have effects he never expected. ""Poor Yuuya...I must have scared him off..."" Rei thought, tilting his head back to allow the water to run freely in his body. Soaping himself up vigorously, he scrubbed his body with the cloth on hand, and rinsed off quickly. Wrapping a new towel on his waist, he went out of the bathroom and into his room to get a new set of clothes. Rei settled for a simple white tee and a pair of shorts he seldom used, one of a dirty white color and outfitted with a lot of pockets. He would have laid down on the bed to stare at the ceiling uselessly when... ""I""ll get it!"" Yuuya shouted from the outside of the room, hearing the doorbell ring. Rei looked towards the door, keenly listening to the sounds below the staircase. He could here Yuuya""s soft voice and a few others as well. Rei sat up immediately, wondering whom the visitors would be. ""Hey, Rei!"" Yuuya suddenly opened the door, Rei intently staring at him. ""You""ve got visitors. They said they""re your childhood friends..."" He said, grinning all the while. Rei cocked an eyebrow, walking towards the door. Passing by the confused Yuuya, Rei simply patted the blonde on his head with his hand; wanting to get a reaction from him. He simply walked downstairs towards the living room; Yuuya following behind, wondering what the simple pat was about. ""Keough! Masaaki! Glad you finally visited!"" Rei smiled, the two visitors suddenly rising from their seats. ""Told ya we could visit!"" Keough beamed, Masaaki nodding in agreement. Rei meant for them to sit as he sat down on the opposite side of the living room. ""Good evening, Mrs. Otohata!"" Keough waved at the woman who passed by. Mrs. Otohata smiled, waving the same as well as to Masaaki, before turning back to the leaves she was burning outside. ""Rei, who is that blonde? A friend of yours?"" Masaaki pointed at Yuuya, who came nearer to give them tea and a pile of biscuits on a tray. Masaaki said his thanks and took the cup, blowing at it slightly before sipping a bit. ""He""s Yuuya Asou, a close friend of mine."" Rei introduced him to both of them, Yuuya promptly bowing. ""Yuuya, the blonde Australian is Keough Rynn, and the other one with the glasses is Masaaki Tsukiyono.",583064
1832,"she poured more chakra, using everything she had learned to stop the bleeding. ""Sasuke!"" His lips opened as he croaked, ""Sa..kura.."" She forced a smile on her face. ""Sasuke, you""ll be alright, you hear me? The war""s over, we won,"" she bit her lip as she tried to stop the tears that fell against his pale face. ""..Sasuke we""re going home."" He coughed, blood dribbling down the side of his mouth. ""..Aa."" And he closed his eyes. Naruto screamed for Sasuke-teme to open his damn eyes! But Sakura gripped his shoulder and shook her head. ""He""s just exhausted, Naruto,"" she assured, the green glow of her hands fading, as she collapsed beside the black-haired Uchiha. Tentatively, she reached for his chest, his heart beating weakly but rhythmically beneath her palm. She had stopped the bleeding, he would live. ""Sakura-chan! Sasuke!"" Naruto wailed, tears streaming down his face as he and his clone took hold of his teammates and carried them on his back. ""Come on! Let""s go home!"" That day, Uzumaki Naruto finally brought home all of his teammates back to Konoha. The day before they were married, she and Sasuke met at daybreak wearing their best kimono, hers a pale pink with white obi and his a grey piece embroidered with the Uchiha clan symbol. She smiled at him and he nodded back, as they set out for the Konoha graveyard. They first visited her parents"" tombstones. Haruno Kizashi and Haruno Mebuki had unfortunately been part of the casualties of the war, and it still hurt Sakura that she hadn""t been there to save them. ""Mom, Dad,"" Sakura whispered as she lovingly traced the names carved on the cold marble. ""This is Sasuke. Remember him? He""s my teammate."" Her gaze shifted to the male Uchiha, ""I""m marrying him tomorrow. I hope you""ll give us your blessing."" Sasuke knelt beside her, his head bowed, his eyes closed. He was silent for a few minutes before murmuring, ""I, Uchiha Sasuke, will take care of your daughter Sakura."" She held his hand in hers and squeezed it. ""I""m sure Sasuke-kun will, mom, dad,"" she agreed with a smile. At the Uchiha graveyard, Sakura bowed low in front of Uchiha Fugaku and Uchiha Mikoto""s resting place, her hands clasped primly in front on her lap. ""I am Haruno Sakura. I...I promise to take care of Sasuke-kun."" ""My mother,"" Sasuke spoke quietly beside her, ""Would have loved you, Sakura. She always wanted a daughter."" The corner of his lips curved upward, ""Father, too, I suppose. He had his hands full of boys instead."" Sakura chuckled. ""Don""t worry, we""ll give them cute granddaughters one day."" He clasped her hand, the first rays of the sun striking his hair as a small smile tugged on his lips. ""We will, Sakura. We will."" She always thought Sasuke was an early riser, but after being married to him for almost half a year, she found that she always woke up first. And she loved those moments. She savored the silence of dawn as she would slowly open her eyes and crane her neck to gaze at his sleeping face. He was more relaxed during these times, the area between his brows smoothened.",560480
2700,"Jack got up pulling Fi up with him... he looked around the room and put his protective arms around Fi walking themselves over to Carey, Clu and Annie. ""Whoa what in the world is that?"" Clu shook his head in confusion to Annie""s question. Carey used a chair for support against his shaking knees. ""I know what that was"" Everyone turned to Fi. ""What was it Fi? We are waiting for an explanation"" Fi turned to Annie and smiled at her. ""Okay... now before anyone says anything... I got a story for you."" Jack opened his mouth to protest but Carey motioned for him to listen. Annie, Carey, Clu and Jack sat down on the ground meanwhile Fi sat down in the chair in front of her... she scanned the papers and put them down. ""Okay the story I have to tell you takes place in the past. The year was 1930... it revolves around a young boy named Daniel McMann. Daniel lived in this actual house. Daniel wasn""t popular but he wasn""t unpopular... he was unknown to the town of Hope Springs. Daniel didn""t really have friends but he didn""t really have enemies either... he was a sweet boy and was nice to anyone and everyone. Well one day in school... Hope springs high.... Daniel was sitting down at the cafeteria table eating his usual ham and cheese sandwich enjoying his lunch not bothering anyone when two popular kids David Phillips and Clark Bell walked over to Daniel and poured milk all over him for no reason at all. All the kids in the school broke out in laughter.... Except one girl.... Stephanie Thielen... she was dating David Phillips.... She wasn""t laughing because she did not find what they were doing to Daniel funny. Daniel grabbed his books and ran.... He ran as fast as he could... not looking back. He staggered back to his home trying to breathe but he felt as if he was being choked... Daniel ran into his house and collapsed onto the living room floor... where you are sitting now. See there was something that Clark, David and even Stephanie didn""t know... Daniel was allergic to milk and if he came in contact with milk the results could be deadly. So lying on the floor Daniel felt his body go weak... bumps appeared on his face and his breathing stopped.... Because of David and Clark""s little prank Daniel lost his life... in this same house and David and Clark were never caught because Stephanie Thielen, the only one who could bring justice to the town of Hope Springs for Daniel covered for them"" Annie, Carey, Clu and Jack stared at Fi in silence. ""And I think because he was wronged and died before his time his spirit has lived on to torment the people who did this to him... trying to right a wrong. Carey asked me how we were a part of this.... David, Clark, and Stephanie were our great great grandparents"" Again Carey, Clu, Jack and Annie stared at Fi in silence. Annie got up messing with her hair. ""So you""re saying our ancestors wronged Daniel McMann and now we are paying for it? Because they did a bad we are gonna die?"" Fi shook her head. ""Not necessarily.",29783
1518,"You and Alphonse can sleep in the empty room, tonight...Noah, when you""re tired, you can stay in my room with me."" Then she led him out of the kitchen and upstairs. ""Sorry..."" Ed said while she was putting clean sheets on the bed. She looked over at him. He looked up, ""I just don""t like to talk about my old job is all."" He""d wanted to forget some of the last few years. Who could blame him? He still felt responsible for the death of Alphonse Heinrich, his brother""s counterpart in this world. Not to mention other deaths that happened during the attempted ""conquest"" of his world. A group of lunatics thought the other side of the gate was a mythical land of peace and prosperity...If only they""d known it was as imperfect as this one. ""Oh, that""s fine...Russel""s just keen on flying and the possibility of space travel,"" she said as she fluffed the pillows. Ed nodded, then looked around the room. On a desk, he saw a photo, and recognized Winry""s parents...Even they were the same. Odd. He picked it up, then smiled. Winry was a cute kid...To think instead of him and Al this one had grown up with the Tringams. ""Are these your parents?"" he asked, even though he didn""t have to. Winry stood up and came over, then looked over his shoulder. She leaned on his back, one arm on his sholder. He bit his lip...He could feel her chest pressed to his back. What was wrong with him? He never noticed things like that before. ""Yes,"" she said, her mouth by his ear. ""My mother died when I was still small...about a year after this was taken...My dad died a few years ago, during the war. He was a doctor, but he loved his work, and died doing it,"" she said. ""He and doctor Marshal, our local doctor in town, worked together a lot... but before all that, Dad had been the one who taught me about mechanics and such."" ""I""m sorry you lost them,"" Ed said, remembering the Rockbells. ""I""m sure they were wonderful people... But why are you so familiar with the church?"" he asked. ""Oh, well, I""ve spent a lot of time alone, and I go down so often its really like a second home."" she giggled, blowing breath against his cheek, ""A few people in the village actually call me ""Sister Winifred""...But I could never be a nun."" ""Oh, that""s good,"" Ed said, relieved, then he blushed, backed up, and looked at her, ""I mean...um...I mean, that""s good, because...Because you really should meet a nice guy and settle down, not be stuck in a church all the time- Not that there""s anything wrong with that!"" he added, waving his hands, and the picture still in one. ""Its just...From what I""ve seen, it might not be for you."" Why don""t I shut up already?! Winry""s face had been red the entire time, but now she laughed, ""Its alright... I""m still oung, I have plenty of time to think about it."" ""I agree with Edward,"" Russel said from the doorway. Ed and Winry both looked over. Ed frowned, and inwardly was ticked. That jerk had spied on them! He""d probably been there the whole time, listening in! ""How long were you there?""",512464
3774,"""Okay I won""t"" Sam buried her face into Harrison""s chest and started to cry again. *end of flashback* They all had stood there for a while in the middle of the room and watched as Harrison held a crying Sam in his arms, they didn""t say a word... not even George, they just watched in silence. Maybe they were afraid that if someone said something that things would get even worse, so they just kept their mouths shut and watched, not knowing what else to do. Brooke had been through a lot of things in her life: popularity, unpopularity, eating disorder but seeing her best friend and sister to be crying after almost being raped by some college creep was all new to her and it was the most terrifying thing she could have seen and all she knew was that the horrified look Sam had on her face would be branded into her memory forever. After a few minutes Harrison suggested that they take Sam home; Harrison held Sam in his arms on what seemed to Brooke McQueen the longest car ride home. Sam""s cries were heard throughout the whole car even though they weren""t loud, the cries echoed in everybody""s ears and all they could do was try to remember that time would heal this experiment gone terribly wrong. George had let Harrison hold Sam, it was what she wanted and if Harrison was the key to make Sam to be able to smile again then George would back away until she called for him to come back... she would call him back, at least he hoped she would. Lily and Carmen had insisted on coming with Harrison and Brooke to be with Sam too but Harrison told them to go home and get some rest, that all Sam needed right now was some sleep and that they could see her in the morning. Harrison had stayed with Sam for a few hours and then Sam insisted he go home so his mother wouldn""t worry, Harrison had tried to protest but Sam told him she still had Brooke and she was okay and then he had left too. Now it was just Brooke and Sam in their room and neither one had said a word since Harrison left... until Brooke managed to force out Sam""s name; The silence was killing Brooke, the awful silence in the room was deafening and Brooke needed something to break the ice, she needed conversation even if it was Sam screaming at her and hitting... anything was good. ""Huh?"" Sam tore her dazed stare away from the ceiling and turned on her stomach facing Brooke; she saw the saddened look on Brooke""s face and she felt like telling Brooke everything was going to be alright but she couldn""t since she didn""t know if that was the truth. She had almost been raped tonight... if it wasn""t for Harrison, she would have been raped and Sam couldn""t just dismiss that to make Brooke or anyone else feel better. She knew that what happened tonight was nobody""s fault but it still hurt and she didn""t know if it was ever going to stop hurting, she couldn""t even look George in the eyes without tearing up but it was just different with Harrison.",29783
1446,"Occasionally I would close my eyes and pray that sleep would overcome me like him, but it never did. It was hard getting to sleep nowadays wondering if you""d wake up the next morning. On top of the cancer, I was having to deal with the creepy ghosts that were haunting the house. Their activity had seemed to double tremendously over the course of the time. They""d harass me, scare me, and even reach out and touch me just to get me to squeal in fright. They were slowly driving me mad, and now I had no one to turn to, so as to find comfort. It was almost as if Matt had written me off at some point. The only comfort I ever found were in my dreams. In my dreams I was back home in Tennessee, back at the lake enjoying the breeze and the sun as it caressed my skin and hair. The blades of grass tickled against the skin that dared to touch it. The smell was intoxicating, as I would breathe in the smell of wild honeysuckle, but most of all my dreams consisted of him. For some odd reason I now felt comfort in Jonah""s presence. Something about him calmed me, and it helped a lot that he now came to me in human form, and not the charred self he was. He never talked, he always listened and touched. I was starting to fear that he had no voice, but then I reminded myself of the time he had spoken his name, and it brought comfort. Oh how I wish I could fall asleep soon so I could feel that comfort, but alas, I was stuck in the real world, fully awake in the basement with the one person who treated me as if I was a ghost like Jonah himself. Eventually I gave up trying to sleep and turned my head to continue reading the book I had bought earlier that day with Sara. It was the sequel to Evermore something called Blue Moon. To be honest it related way to much Twilight, except for the fact that it was about immortals not Vampires. Oh, and not to mention the ghost of the girl""s dead sister. How creepy would it be to have a ghost haunting you day in and day out? That""s right, I do have a ghost, or shall I say ghosts, haunting me day in, and day out. Sighing in exhaustion I sat the book down and turned off the light hoping that maybe now sleep would overcome me. As I lie there with my eyes closed I listened to the soft snores coming from across the room and the rain pattering against the house. It had started raining earlier that day and it hadn""t even started to let up by nightfall. Now the sounds of thunder could be heard, and the room lit up every few minutes as the lightning flashed, and yet Matt never stirred. I jumped as the thunder cracked loudly this time. It had sounded almost like a gunshot. I had to almost restrain myself from jumping out of bed and running to Matt. I refused to wake him from his peaceful sleep. Rarely did he get it. I continued to try and count sheep as the rain poured, and finally when I was almost able to slip into sleep the thunder cracked again making me jump in fright and squeal. I heard a chuckle from the other side of the room and immediately realized Matt had woken up.",806976
2135,"Selina stood in the hall for a second, still going over the surreal encounter, trying to figure out what emotion she was feeling. Then she decided on anger and tore off to Bruce""s room. She straddled him as she poked him, saying his name repeatedly. Bruce opened his eyes slowly, grinning at the view, but Selina was in no mood. ""You have a son?"" He groaned, still half-asleep but placing his hands on her hips. ""What?"" ""Bruce, I know we decided on not needing chit-chat about what""s happening in the other person""s life, but a kid might be worth mentioning."" Bruce yawned and shrugged. ""Figured you already knew, it""s been all over the news as of late."" He began to rub her backside, but Selina was having none of that. ""You couldn""t have said anything at dinner? Nothing at all?"" Bruce was fully-awake now, in more ways than one, and met Selina""s green eyes full-on. ""I didn""t think you""d care."" Selina ignored body part pressing against her, still upset. ""Bruce, I care when I met your adopted son half-naked in the hallway."" Bruce smiled. ""Really?"" ""It""s not funny."" He continued to smile. ""Selina you probably just made a few of his dreams come true, as long as he didn""t see anything, no harm done."" He sat up to kiss her, but Selina wasn""t finished just yet. As he peppered her neck she ask, ""What about me? Maybe I""m emotionally scared."" Bruce chuckled against her shoulder as he removed his shirt from her, ""You""d eat him alive."" She smiled at that and forced him to look at her again, ""But still, you""re a father now, Bruce. How can we continue?"" He sighed. ""I""ll guess we""ll just be friends."" He kissed her deeply and moved her beneath him. When he released her lips she agreed. ""Just friends."" As he moved his lips down her body, she had a feeling she was going to enjoy this friendship. Well Met - Part Seven As Lucius spoke to the board about the company""s financial status, Bruce had on a well-practiced look of boredom. Bruce had already privately discussed the matter with Lucius, and used this time to think on other things. Lately, Gordon""s daughter had begun dressing in a bat costume; he tolerated it at first since she worked well with Dick, who Bruce was currently at a loss with. It""d been so much easier when Dick was ten, but lately, even Barbara couldn""t keep Dick in line. With Dick acting out, Bruce had no desire to deal with an angry police commissioner should the man ever figure out what his daughter was up to at night. Bruce""s train of thought was interrupted when his assistant popped her head in, ""Mr. Wayne? Miss Kyle is here."" Bruce stood. ""Thank you, Candace. Tell her I""ll meet her in my office in a moment."" Candace nodded and left. Bruce excused himself from the meeting, but before he could leave Lucius took his arm, whispering, ""Bruce, you cannot leave a board meeting to meet one of your bimbos. There""s an important matter we must address."" Bruce was surprised at Lucius. ""Selina""s hardly a bimbo, Lucius, and you should know that."" Lucius looked apologetic. ""I know; Selina is far above your usual standards.",1497577
481,"He threw her into the jail cell while she was distracted and the lock engaged automatically behind her. She fought against the bars, calling and reaching out to the fallen man, ""Jacques!"" As she stood over him, Esme pushed the button again. She sneered over him, as he groaned in pain. He could barely be heard as he said, ""Mercy."" ""I have no sympathy for stealers of sugar bowls, Snicket!"" She pushed the button again. ""Wrong Snicket, Esme,"" Jacques managed before passing out. Esme either didn""t hear what he""d said or didn""t care. She walked away from the man, bringing out her keys to unlock her boyfriend""s cell. She also reset her taser. Olivia could hear Olaf""s laughter. She began to cry, but Esme pointed her taser at the librarian now. ""Shut up,"" Esme said as Olivia fell, losing consciousness as well. They woke up hours later, both trapped in cells, and dawn""s first rays coming through the barred windows. Olaf was banging a night stick against the cell""s bars, making an awful noise, especially for someone had lost consciousness involuntarily. ""Rise and shine, Snicket and..."" He looked at her. ""...and librarian. Your trial begins soon."" Olivia could hear Jacques spring to his feet. She admired him, as she didn""t think she could stand, but she tried to anyway. She used the wall to prop herself up. Jacques said, ""I""m not sure what you""re plan is, but you won""t get away with this."" She heard the other cell unlock, heard handcuffs lock and watched as they brought Jacques out. He looked to her, his eyes telling her to stay strong. Olivia noticed that his hair had been restyled and an eyebrow glued to his forehead. Esme approached her cell now, looking for the right key for her. One of the twins had a second pair of handcuffs ready. Jacques asked, ""What do you Olaf rolled his eyes and snorted, ""Well of course, I, a world famous investigator of some sort, caught both Count Olaf and his girlfriend."" His eyes shot to Jacques. ""I""m not incompetent like some."" Olivia put together the plan in an instant and she guessed so had Jacques who then said, ""If you do that, I will insist that Jerome Squalor be called to identify his wife. Jerome may not be the brightest bulb in the pack, but I do believe he will recognize his own wife. While the years have changed me, I believe he will recognize his former best friend as well."" Olaf studied the other man""s eyes before walking away. ""We can""t risk it. Leave the librarian."" The women looked visibly disappointed by his order, Esme even walking over to Olaf. ""By threatening her, we might get the location of the sugar bowl from that one."" Her eyes shot to Jacques. Olaf shook his head, ""That doesn""t matter right now."" Esme screeched, ""Yes it does. The sugar bowl is all that matters!"" Olaf""s mouth opened as one of his hands went up to rub the ear that had been closest to Esme""s yell. ""Calm down, my love. Once we get the cops off my back, we""ll collect both sets of orphans and then the sugar."" Seemingly mollified, Esme strode out. Olaf grumbled behind her, pushing Jacques forward.",1497577
3633,"Even though the teacher might be understanding, the idea of all those eyes on him made him cringe. He""d rather get the detention for skipping than embarrass himself like that. He waiting in the restroom for the end of the period, working on his Spanish homework. It seemed like he spent most of his time waiting. Five minutes before the bell was to go, he decided it was time to go. The one good thing about skipping class was the opportunity to get to his next class safely, assuming none of the jocks had chosen to skip as well. Gathering his book bag and the grocery bag he""d placed his stained clothing, Kurt set off for his science class. His route took him passed the school bulletin board, the one where clubs placed their announcements. For some reason, a blank sign-up sheet caught his eye, and he came to a stop in from of it. It was advertising the school""s glee club, which had recently been reformed. Kurt considered it for a second. His father was always encouraging him to get involved in some kind of school activity. He took another step closer, reaching into his pants pocket for a pencil, before his common sense got caught up with his impulse. He loved to sing, but that didn""t mean he could stand being on stage in front of people. He thought his soprano was good, but it was also very unusual and might open him up to more ridicule. While he liked the idea of Glee, it wouldn""t be smart to join. The last thing Kurt needed was to attract anyone""s attention. Four. As usual, there was a shifting in the guy""s room when Kurt Hummel made his grand entrance, resplendent in D & G. Instead of heading for the urinals, he went directly for the sink and pulled out a compact to touch-up his cheek. He""d had a breakout last night, and there was no way he wanted anyone to get a look at it. Even though it was on the edge of his hairline, it still had the potential to embarrass him. Finn, standing in front of the urinal, didn""t bother calling a greeting, since he was doing his own private thing and, you know, having his dingdong out make him self-conscious. But he did note the other Gleek""s arrival, knowing he""d have to step in if the other guys decided today was a good day for swirlies. Usually he""d let them do whatever, but he was supposed to work on a duet with Kurt, and having to spend the afternoon as the main focus of Kurt""s sarcasm would totally suck. Finn finished zipping up his jeans and went to the sink next to Kurt in an attempt to make sure no one could get at the male diva easily. There were all kinds of swine flu warning signs, which actually concerned him enough that he was going to wash his hands. Most of the time he didn""t bother, but the last thing he wanted was to get sick. He""d heard that it wasn""t good for pregnant women, and heaven knew he""d already done enough to piss Quinn off in the last twenty four hours (though Finn still wasn""t sure what was wrong with wanting to have sex since it wasn""t like he could make her pregnant again... unless that was how twins were made).",1112924
2181,"""Hello, from being eaten and defiled by Kouga- who by the way was really a Werewolf. That""s totally bad judgment on your part, Grandpa, for engaging me to the Wolf-man."" ""But... but... What is He!?"" ""Oh, he""s a dog... I think... He was certainly an animal last night."" Kagome said, hopping back in bed with the creature. They put their arms around each other, and smiled. Kagome""s grandpa just sighed, and said, ""Well, you""d better come down and have breakfast, anyway. I""ll look for some clothes for him."" The old man wandered, mumbling about ""what this world was coming to... young maidens sleeping with dog-men... what a disgrace!' Act Five: Scene Three That afternoon, in town hall, just as the sun was going down, Officer Miroku and Inspector Sesshoamru waited in the meeting room. ""Sorry I""m late,"" the Mayor said as he strolled in, wiping his mouth, ""I had some important business to attend to. Seems there""s an increase on young ladies escaping- I mean- disappearing from the nunnery."" ""I have come to report on my observations of Young Dr. Von Yugistein."" Sesshomaru said. ""At first, he seemed only to be a very nervous, an disturbed, man. Now, I have had reports of him and tow of his house servants wandering the country side, scouring graveyards, and that hideous hunchbacked minion of his popping up in the sewers. I believe they are hiding something."" ""Or perhaps looking for it,"" Miroku suggested. ""There was a report about young Kouga having never returned home last night."" ""Kouga... wasn""t he the son of the Werewolf we shot?"" the Mayor asked. ""Uh, yes, I believe he is."" Miroku said, looking at his notes. ""Just like it says that your father, before we held elections, was the Count of this province..."" ""I am not a vampire,"" the Mayor insisted. ""I am NOT a VAMPIRE!"" Just then, the vent in the floor popped open, and Joegore""s head came up. ""Have any of you guys seen a monster with dog ears and long white flowin hair, looks almost human?"" the grotesque hunchback asked them. ""I""ll go rally the angry mob,"" Miroku said calmly. ""We have two monsters to chase out."" he said, eyeing Mayor von Kaiba. ""Better make that four,"" Joegore said as he went back down through the vent, ""His mayorship""s wife and brother ain""t too happy about bein buried alive,"" Joegore turned to Kaiba, and gave him a thumb""s up, saying, ""By the way, she""s a real looker. If things don""t work out, can I a shot at her?"" ""GET OUT!!!"" von Kaiba shouted. Joegore cringed, and slammed the vent cover closed behind him. ""Maybe I shouldn""t have asked them about the monster..."" Joegore wondered. ""I hope the Doctor finds him before the angry mob."" Act Five: Scene Four Kagome held Inu-yasha""s hand as they snuck around the streets of the village. She knew if he was found, he was dead meat. ""Okay, now do smell the scent to your home?"" she asked him. Inu-yasha sniffed, then shook his head. ""No."" ""Okay then, we""ll just have to keep walking until we find it. And don""t worry, I promise I""ll visit you everyday."" As they began to walk off, Inu-yasha""s ears pricked. He turned around. ""What is it?"" Kagome asked.",512464
2441,"The couple""s body language wasn""t right for this to be a date; the man wasn""t trying to sneak any sly touches, and the woman was brisk in her movement, not flirtatious. Both of them declined wine, instead asking for virgin drinks since this was a luncheon. The woman made a point of requesting a duplicate receipt ""for business purposes"" as they ordered just appetizers and entrees, skipping the other usual courses. ""We need to be back to the office by four if we""re going to meet our lawyers,"" the man pointed out. Meiko thought it was weird to be closing a deal on Sunday, but knew that some businesses worked weird hours. She smiled as she took the order back to the kitchen, pausing as she glanced back at the couple. On the surface, they were exactly what they appeared to be, but she hadn""t missed the inadvertent way the man""s voice had softened as he spoke to the woman, or the way the woman was careful not to look any longer than appropriate at her dining companion. They each held themselves stiffly, but not in the usual manner of business professionals. Instead, their stiffness seemed to be derived from fighting an unwanted attraction. Nanako was in the kitchen again, polishing silverware (as Meiko had been saved from doing it). ""Everything going alright? You look thoughtful."" ""There""s a pair out there that are... curious,"" Meiko said. Grinning, she held up her little finger as Nanako had done a month ago. ""They want to be, but..."" she paused. ""Never let it be said that the Japanese don""t have perfect work ethics."" Nanako looked at Meiko""s pinkie, before chortling. ""Like the boy and that man last month?"" ""Much less fulfilled,"" Meiko said, before stopping. Something about the memory of the bishounen and his would-be lover struck her then. And like a jigsaw, it all fell together. ""Every two weeks,"" she said softly. ""Every two weeks."" To her credit, Nanako didn""t play stupid. ""They""ve been doing this for years,"" she said. ""The staff just plays along, since they""re such excellent customers. Whenever we get a new waitress, they""re seated in her section so the act is a bit more natural. You caught on pretty quick - it took me four months to figure it out."" ""Who are they?"" Meiko demanded. The whole idea of dressing up and acting at a restaurant, without an audience, struck her as a bit insane. ""I promised I wouldn""t tell,"" Nanako said piously, before offering a wink. ""Though I might confirm if you guess right."" Meiko allowed herself to scowl, but really was intrigued by the challenge. She thoughtfully twisted a strand from her ponytail around her finger as she thought on the situation. Nanako expected her to know who they were, which meant they were likely famous. It also wouldn""t do to let them know the gig was up; if they""d been coming here for years to play this game, management would not be thrilled by an outright confrontation. Taking a deep breath, she forced herself to relax. Mentally she cataloged the parts of her body - neck, shoulders, arms, back, waist, hips, legs, feet - and concentrated on releasing the tension there. So they wanted to act?",1112924
2143,"It will be a tradition. And who knows, maybe it""ll bring our tributes luck."" This time Haymitch waited. Effie lifted her glass, she bit her lip and looked to the designers. Haymitch said, ""If we wait for them, it""ll be the end of the Games before you get your toast."" A chuckle slipped out, but Effie repressed it quickly. Haymitch grinned, pleased to find that the escort did in fact have a sense of humor. She raised her glass, ""To victory and good odds."" Haymitch added, ""To death and stacked decks."" Effie didn""t like his added negativity, but they clinked glasses and downed their drinks before sitting down to watch the opening ceremonies. Both kids had died on the first day, and Haymitch had found himself in the bar that evening. Chaff still had a girl in it, so he was talking with sponsors. Part of Haymitch wondered why his friend bothered, but he was also envious that Chaff still had that much hope. He downed another whiskey. Haymitch had lost all of his so long ago. ""Is this seat taken?"" Haymitch closed his eyes, unwilling to look at the other man, ""Aren""t you busy right now? With the games being on and all."" Plutarch looked at the television that was jumping from one sleeping child to another, only the career guard was awake. He whispered, ""Don""t tell anyone, but there""s no excitement planned until tomorrow afternoon."" Haymitch""s voice was dripped in sarcasm. ""Oh goody."" ""Can I buy you a drink?"" ""Look, I don""t know what your deal is, but I prefer the company of women."" Plutarch chuckled lowly. ""I don""t want to sleep with you, Haymitch."" ""Then what do you want?"" Plutarch looked at the bartender, and with a movement of his head dismissed the man. When they were alone, he still whispered, ""Your help."" Haymitch looked up at the television, Chaff""s girl happened to be on. She looked cold. ""I can""t help anyone."" ""You are a clever victor with nothing left to lose. You must realize how important, how dangerous, you could be."" Haymitch looked unconvinced, pouring himself another drink from the now unattended bar, so Plutarch continued, ""Everyone knows that District 12 suffers the most under Snow""s regime. You could make a real difference for your home and we need a representative from 12."" ""What you""re suggesting..."" Haymitch stopped himself from completing that sentence. They were in the Capitol; it was suicidal to have a conversation like this here. But one thing stuck out from what Plutarch had said. ""A representative, just how many victors have you recruited?"" Plutarch shifted. ""Enough."" ""That tells me nothing."" ""I can""t risk their exposure, especially if you decide not to join."" ""You""re exposing yourself by talking to me."" Plutarch smiled, ""Who are they going to believe - a respected gamemaker or a drunken victor?"" The man was clever, Haymitch had to give him credit there. And ballsy for even suggesting such a thing, even though he hadn""t spelled it out, Haymitch could infer what Plutarch was driving at. Haymitch wanted it confirmed, ""Are you suggesting a protest by the victors?"" ""No. What we""re looking for is all out war against the Capitol.""",1497577
243,"""It""s too dangerous. Besides, you and I both know neither one of them wouldn""t end up hurt."" ""So what do I do?"" ""Just stay here."" Kludd pinned Soren down on a tree and looked very menacing like, as if he""s planning on killing his own brother. Soren panted heavily and Kludd asked, ""Any last words...brother?"" ""Kludd, please don""t do this to me. I""m your brother."" ""You""re weak, Soren. Weaker as you""ll ever be. And this is what happens if I sense weakness."" Kludd throws Soren to the ground and suddenly calls out Travis"" name. ""TRAVIS!"" Travis felt fearful when he heard Kludd call his name. ""COME DOWN HERE THIS INSTANT!"" Suddenly, he remembered that he wasn""t gonna be afraid anymore, because he confronted his fears earlier and he was more than fed up with putting up with Kludd and all his abuse. He looked down on the side of the mountain, sees Kludd there and told him, ""No."" Kludd suddenly became outraged and shouted, ""NO?"" ""Yeah, what are you deaf and stupid? I said ""no.' I""ve had it with taking crap from you and you shouldn""t kill your brother either. What has he ever done to you anyway?"" ""I""ve already told you! He thinks he""s so much better than me! Well, I wish he would die!"" Soren gasped in shock, knowing that Kludd would say something about his brother that way. He said, ""You don""t mean that."" ""Yes...I do."" He slowly walks to Soren, raising his talons up and said, ""Goodbye...brother."" ""KLUDD!"" Then, he turns around and sees Noctus standing there. He told him, ""Think about what you""re doing! This is your brother!"" ""I HAVE NO BROTHER! And I""m sure as heck have no father either!"" ""Son..."" ""You always stick up for Soren and his stupid dreams! Why do you and mom like him more than me?"" ""Kludd, that is not true. We don""t love Soren more than you do. Me and your mother love all three of you very much."" ""Lies, lies, lies! All lies! You""re just saying that so you can protect Soren!"" ""Listen to me, this is not the way you would treat your brother. And you got Eglantine moon-blinked."" ""What""s your point? No matter what I do, it""s never gonna be good enough!"" Nyra flies in and chuckled evilly. She said, ""Kludd..do what you must."" ""Yes, my queen."" ""Kludd, if you kill your brother...not only will you have hurt the Guardians, you""ll also hurt our family and yourself."" ""Don""t listen to him! He""s obviously weaker."" Nyra shouted. ""Mind your own business!"" Kludd looked at Soren and plans to kill him. He angrily stares at him and raises his talons directly towards his stomach and plans to stab him, but as soon as it happened, he looked into Soren""s eyes and a small tear falls down on his hazel eye. When he looked into his eye, he suddenly snapped out of it and realizes that he""s really trying to kill his own brother. Suddenly, he""s reverting back to the times at the Kingdom of Tytos from childhood. Where both of them were just hatchlings-laughing, playing and having adventures and all. After the flashbacks, Kludd is starting to have second thoughts about killing Soren. Nyra growled impatiently and asked, ""What are you waiting for? Kill him!""",1276465
2740,"Both adults could see that the children were taking their ""job"" very seriously. There was a slight twinkle in Claude""s eye as he glanced over at Esmeralda. ""If you can be very, very good for three days and not get in any trouble at all, we""ll do something special together, just the four of us."" ""What?"" they both demanded. ""You""ll see. Now...finish eating. I have to go check on Jehan."" Esmeralda watched his robes billow out around him as he walked around the corner. Part of her couldn""t help but be very proud of Claude-there was more to him than she""d have ever guessed. Something inside of him was changing for the better. ""Oh, God...Claude, what have you done to me?"" Jehan moaned weakly, ""let me up from this bed at once!"" Claude stayed in the doorway and stared at his younger brother with a brooding, shadowy expression. The sun was rapidly setting and it cast a weak orange light on the man laying helplessly in the cocoon of sheets. ""I will,"" Claude finally said, ""when you are no longer ill."" ""I am NOT ill,"" Jehan responded, ""I simply need a drink and that cures everything. Now get me loose."" Claude shook his head. Jehan glared at him. ""Dammit, Claude! You always were the one to spoil my fun!"" ""Fun? Fun? You call getting drunk, beaten, thrown out of taverns and bars, and getting sick the next morning fun?"" ""At least I have a life,"" Jehan sneered, ""it doesn""t look as though you live at all."" Claude crossed his arms. He would not be swayed by Jehan""s attempts to anger him. ""You""re wrong,"" he said calmly, ""I can""t say my life has always been exciting, but I can remember nearly all of it. How much do you remember, Jehan?"" Jehan was shaking, though with fury or with the beginnings of withdrawal, Claude could not tell. ""Get out."" Claude tipped his head forward, his cool blue-green eyes meeting Jehan""s. ""As you wish."" He closed the door and tried to block out the intense stream of swearing that chased after him. The changes were subtle at first. Jehan became more and more aggressive and nearly escaped a couple of times. Claude had been forced to replace the rags with chains. Jehan hadn""t liked that at all and had actually punched him in the face during an intense struggle. A shadowy bruise now marred Claude""s jawline on one side and it burned like fire. Jacques had heard the struggle from the end of the hall and hurried to assist him. Then, the nastiness started. Jehan was sick to his stomach several times. It seemed as though the cascade of vomit was neverending. Just when they all thought he would surely have emptied himself, fluids were coming up. He was drenched in sweat as though someone had dumped a bucket of water over his head. The sickness didn""t make him any less nasty-it appeared to only make his mouth more vulgar. Claude forbade Esmeralda or the children to enter the hallway lest they overhear Jehan""s vigorous swearing. The convulsions began to come and break up those bouts of swearing. When Jehan went unconscious for the third time, Claude opened the window to try and ventilate the awful smell.",870118

He stared at her face and noticed that she was soaking wet, her hair was drenched and the water had smeared her makeup but he hadn""t noticed, he noticed her but not the smeared makeup. Gina stood slightly behind Dylan surveying every inch of Brenda, she had never been jealous of anyone before because she had no need to but she truly loved Dylan and the girl, the soaked burnette, was the one he loved and not her. ""Bren? Is that you?"" Dylan could hardly believe that she was there. She had to be a dream. Brenda nodded. She tried saying something but her throat got sore and she choked on her words, it had been so long since she talked to him she forgot how to.

She and the others of her party had arrived there nights ago, after the devastation of the great earthquake- another fulfillment of the old prophecy- and now, she feared for her son. And for the others. This enemy was unlike any they had ever fought before. Now, as the night air embraced her, Deedlit stood on the highest balcony. Remembering. ""Oh Parn,"" she said to the wind, ""What would you do? You would probably face this Sorcerer head on, like before. I wish you were here now."" ""I am here, Deed,' she heard his voice say. She turned around. Nothing there. But as she turned around an image seemed to be carried on the wind. ""Parn?"" Deedlit asked, daring not to hope. The specter flew down to the balcony and embraced her. ""I""ve always been with you, Deed,"" Parn""s soul said. ""In all these years, I have never left your side."" ""Oh Parn,"" she said, tears of newfound joy and old grief spilling over her cheeks, ""I""ve had to endure all these years, raising our son, protecting our village all alone.""

A dream. Or was it? Had Parn really come to her? Was her time really that short that his soul would come to consol her in her final days?

Transition Before they entered the leafy green canopies of the south, Magnus stood within the shadows of the leaves, and played his fiddle, in a song of tribute to the wood, and the heroes who""d passed through it before. They had learned of the devastation that the battles had left in Kannon, and now they were to take a short cut through this enchanted forest. The last kingdom of the Elves of Lodoss. ""What""s he doing now?"" Orson complained. ""Barbarian!"" Leaf yelled, striking him again. ""He""s paying homage to our Elven forefathers who tended the green of Lodoss, and tended the woods. If he doesn""t offer the forest something, then it won""t let us pass!"" ""So he""s making an offering?""",512464
3784,"It was then that he realized he was feeling the echoes of a second heartbeat: Aurora""s. He hadn""t known that fear could be so strong, especially from her. It came off of her in sickening waves. Instead of taking her to the dungeons, he detoured to the stable once they were safely away from Iracebeth or any other prying eyes. He put her down carefully and removed the cuffs. With a whistle, his talking horse had emerged from his stall. ""Take her to Marmoreal to the White Queen and do not stop until you get there,"" Stayne ordered the stallion, ""and speak to no one on your way. Your needs will be taken care of once you arrive."" The horse twitched his ear questioningly, but he didn""t protest. ""What about you?"" Aurora asked, obviously very upset. The faintest traces of a smile ghosted his face. ""I""ll manage,"" he told her, ""but only if I know you""re safe."" Unable to speak the words he so desperately wanted to say to her, he allowed her complete access to his thoughts only for a brief second. Tears glistened in her dark eyes. With any luck, he could keep her from spilling more. He held her in his arms for a few more seconds, kissed her deeply, then sat her on the horse""s back. They had so little time that the horse had no saddle or reins. He pitied both of them; it was going to be a rough ride, but his horse knew the way. He walked with them to the gate. Aurora looked back at him as the horse began to gallop away. He watched them vanish into the night. The horse galloped for what seemed like several miles. He slowed to a trot when he began to sweat and breathe hard. Aurora awkwardly shifted and tried not to pull on his mane. ""Are you sure you don""t want to take a break?"" she asked him, unused to the idea that animals could talk. ""No. My master said not to stop,"" he answered, ""I will not disappoint him."" ""All right,"" Aurora said reluctantly. ""If I allow anything to happen to his mate, he will never forgive me,"" the stallion remarked. ""Mate?"" Aurora asked, holding on tighter to keep herself from being jolted off as they covered more treacherous ground. ""He did that thing that humans do...the same as when we touch noses,"" the horse said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. Aurora felt warm on the inside. ""He wouldn""t have done it if he didn""t care so much for you. I""ve only ever seen him do it to you. He""s risking his neck to keep Iracebeth from hurting you."" ""I wanted him to come with us,"" she lamented guiltily. ""You""re doing the right thing by doing what he asks,"" the stallion informed her, ""he won""t get distracted by worrying about you this way. He""ll be able to concentrate in battle."" It took them almost three hours to reach Marmoreal. The stallion told her a little about Stayne""s previous life and their moments together. Stayne had acquired him when he was still a weanling foal. As the horse had grown into a young colt, Stayne had trained and cared for the horse himself. No matter how badly things had gone, they had always found comfort in each other.",870118
3147,"There was a long moment of silence. Then, Shiina opened her eyes again. There was no cat. There was also no sidewalk or road. Instead, Shiina found herself staring ahead, and she instantly spotted the shimmer of her grandfather""s prized kunai sparkling in the darkness of her room. It looked as if the kunai had been thrown with pinpoint accuracy, and it had embedded itself right into the wall. Shiina looked down, only to see that her covers had been thoroughly disturbed. Judging from the fact that no one was ever in this room besides her, she assumed automatically that the one who threw the kunai was none other than herself in her sleep. Shiina sighed to herself as she got out of bed. Thankfully, her grandfather""s kunai had been crafted to perfection, and she doubted even the strongest hammer or the hottest fire could damage its structure. Pulling it out of her wall, she ignored the addition of another hole. It was just one more on top of the twenty other holes randomly strewn across the wall. This kind of thing happened in Shiina""s sleep often. Sitting down on her bed, Shiina put part of her Hamtaro covers over her legs, and hung her head down, wondering just why she was going through all this insanity. Surely, she could control herself. It wasn""t like she hadn""t engineered herself into a ninja by now. It was an arrogant thought, but Shiina was sure she could go out and become a mercenary already. The Japanese government must be looking for someone with her skills. Another thought of TK came up in her head. This time, she managed to push it away. ""No. I will not fall. I am not shallow-minded."" she said to herself, sitting up straight, closing her eyes and taking in a deep breath. She had to focus and filter her mind of all thoughts of TK. She could not, no, she would not let him have this hold over her. He was dumb. He was foolish. He was ridiculous. He was crazed. And most of all; he was so shallow-minded. But he was still cute. Shiina cursed under her breath when she caught her own thought. She just wished for the peaceful silence of dreamless sleep. The less she thought about this fool, the better. T.K ""...if you ask me, Hisako is the most arrogant girl in this school. So what if she can beat just about everyone in Mahjong? So what if she plays guitar so well? I""d like to see her take on entire gangs by herself...like I have!"" Fujimaki complained to a lounging TK, before proceeding to take a big bite out of one of the fried shrimp in his lunch. TK laughed loudly in response to Fujimaki""s remark, before responding with, ""The highway is for gamblers. Better use your sense instead of losing all your cash."" ""Don""t you just lose to her in Mahjong all the time?"" Ooyama commented with an innocent look on his plain face. Matsushita was busy gulping down his mother""s homemade gyūdon. It might have been a little cold, but it was like heaven in his mouth. Besides judo club, lunch was probably Matsushita""s other favorite time of the day. Fujimaki nearly choked on his fried shrimp upon hearing Ooyama""s comment.",967934
462,"This story has been fun to write and I hope you all enjoyed it. Ta Master of the Boot All the Pretty Things: Strangled at birth Bonus chapter part 1: Hell on Earth Warning: This chapter contains graphic rape and torture. Please be warned that the squeamish should turn back. Also, if you""re expecting to find an elegant, romantic Alucard, then forget about it. For Seras Victoria, work was never done. There were respites and the daily period of extinction where she slumbered in a coffin; but at the start of each night there was always more work to be done. The pay for the job was good but there were no weekends and holidays. Other vampires and servants of Alucard got holidays and one day off of the week to rest but for Seras she worked every day. The unfairness of it chafed her but she knew better than to question Alucard""s ""wisdom"": last time she""d done that he ended up slicing off her ass and eating it while she watched. Since having her ass sliced off and eaten wasn""t an experience Seras cared to repeat, she merely went along with whatever he said. Free time was still hell for her. During the two hours a day, Alucard would proceed to humiliate and brutalize her in the vilest of ways. Vampires were not squeamish creatures by nature; they were the undead, damned creatures who turned away from God""s light to become night dwellers forever doomed to suck the life from the living to maintain a charade of animation. Even so, the way that Alucard treated Seras would have horrified all but the most brutal vampires; and even they would have felt uneasy by the sheer lack of restraint he showed around her during those free times. The Captain was her sole comfort in these dark days. During her off hours, she""d spend her hard gotten wages merely so that he could treat her like a queen for a few hours. Unfortunately she never got to spend the night with the Captain, which was her greatest goal currently that didn""t involve not being killed. Tedora the Underage was just as jealous and territorial as ever. She""d slowly developed a chip on her shoulder for Seras. This animosity towards Seras had only grown when Tedora got breast implants. Her once flat, boyish chest now sported a whopping pair of ""A"" cups with pointy nipples that showed off just how much she wasn""t wearing a bra. Seras usually wondered why Tedora""s nipples were erect all the time. It wasn""t that cold in Alucard""s sanctum and there weren""t enough gorgeous men around to provoke arousal for that long a period of time. As she worked at her worker drone job managing Alucard""s daily affairs, her mind wandered to the Captain and his lovely blue eyes. They were such soulful eyes; when one looked into them, what one saw looked like power, wisdom and the ruins of youth. Shuffling papers and writing in dates, Seras began to think of the Captain""s straw coloured hair. Looking like straw, the Captain""s hair felt like silk and Seras had spent whole sessions just feeling his hair and petting him like some kind of giant, friendly pet.",1220273
2257,"""If only Tamura-sensei and I were like that..."" Mikami-sensei sighed. An image of him chasing Tamura-sensei flashed in his mind. The palm trees, the setting sun...oh so romantic! ""If only that woman fall from heaven."" Mikami-sensei wondered loudly. ""AHHHHH!!!!!!"" A voice rang through the air. Mikami-sensei""s eyes widened from what he saw. A woman falling from the sky. Instinctively, he opened his arms and tried to catch her. ""I""ll catch you! I""ll catch you! I""ll-"" The woman fell at him. ""Ouch! That was a soft landing"" The woman exclaimed. Her eyes widened when she saw that she was sitting on a man. ""I""m so sorry!!! I can explain myself!"" The lady helped Mikami-sensei up. Mikami-sensei was utterly speechless. The lady was so beautiful. Is that what they call love at first sight?, he thought. ""Um..excuse me?"" The lady inquired. Mikami-sensei was staring at her. It made her feel nervous ""Oh, sorry. Um...what""s you name? Why are you here?"" Mikami-sensei couldn""t help asking too much. ""My name is Kirishima Mito."" She bowed. ""I am here because I want to see my brother."" ""Kirishima?"" Mikami-sensei thought for a while. ""As in Kirishima Yuta?"" ""Yes. Do you know him, Mikami-sensei? "" She smiled. ""Um..yes. Hey! How did you know my name?"" Mikami-sensei asked. ""It is written on your pen. Here."" Mito gave Mikami-sensei his pen. ""Ah..well, you see, this is a gift from a friend."" Mikami-sensei scratched his head. ""Anyway, could you please help me? I need to speak to the Orihara""s. Maybe they could let me stay with my brother here. Being at home is so boring."" Mito asked. ""Of course!"" Mikami-sensei smiled. He has found her. ""Okay. I""m again lost."" Kaji said. He was trying to find his way to the dinning room. It was almost lunch. ""Are you Kaji-kun?"" A voice interrupted his thoughts. He turned to find the servant from last night. ""Um..yes. Are you Tateishi Ayu?"" Kaji asked. She is so beautiful. Her hair""s so nice, he thought. ""Yes. Do you want me to lead you to the dinning room?"" She smiled warmly. ""uh...yes please."" Kaji answered. ""Please follow me."" Ayu led the way. The trip to the dinning room was silent. Kaji was busy looking at Ayu while Ayu was busy stealing glances on Kaji. At last, they reached the dinning room. ""Here we are."" Ayu opened the doors for Kaji. Kaji took Ayu""s hand. He kissed it. That gesture made Ayu blush furiously. ""Thank you, my dear lady."" Kaji said in his ""gentleman"" manner. ""It""s...nothing. I""m a servant here so you don""t need to be so respectful."" Ayu said as she tried to speak calmly. ""It""s just you""re so kind that you are worthy of it..not that the others are not worth it."" Kaji smiled. It made Ayu blush even more, if it was possible. ""See you again, Tateishi."" Kaji walked inside. Ayu stood there for a while. Just then, a voice interrupted her thoughts. She shivered. Is it her or the air became rather cold? ""Good for you. I hope the prince will treat me that way too."" Luna muttered. She smiled bitterly at Ayu. ""Luna-sama."" Ayu bowed. Her aura""s so dark and cold, she thought. ""No need to place the '-sama"". Why am I so unlucky?",560480
3616,"""No."" ""You""re gonna punish me for this?"" ""I am."" She slammed the door in his face. Stick Together Roman pulled the chair out for her and she sat down. She was a black dress, the neck wrapped around her shoulders, but covered her cleavage. It came down around her knees, black high heels. She was wearing the pearl necklace he had got her and her hair was done at the top of her head in a bun. He sat down across from her and grabbed the menu, she leaned on her elbow and watched as he sifted through the pages. The restaurant was dimly lit under candlelight, with a glass vase with a rose in it at the center of each table. It was extremely expensive, but she wasn""t surprised. It was, however, their first time going there, it was their anniversary after three years of being happily in a relationship. His eyes looked up from the menu at her and his tongue came out to lick his wooden lips. ""What are you looking at? I thought you wanted to come here."" He was snappy, mostly because she insisted he didn""t clear out the restaurant like he always did. So many people were staring and whispering amongst themselves and most of the conversation was about him. ""I did and I am very happy that you brought me here, Roman."" He sighed and looked back down at the menu. She looked around the restaurant, woman were glaring at her as if she was a monster, they were glaring at him just as much. ""I am gonna go to the bathroom. I will be back."" ""Hurry up, will ya?"" ""You know what I want. Can you order for me?"" ""Sure, sure."" He waved her off as she left for the bathroom. She brought her purse with her, powdering her nose and reapplying her makeup. Moments later after her two woman walked in, one with brown hair and brown eyes, the other with auburn hair and hazel eyes. They stood on either side of her, prepping themselves as she was. ""So... You with Mr. Sionis?"" Lina stopped applying her mascara, she looked at the brunette through the mirror. ""That""s not really any of your business, but yes."" ""Hmm... Shocked. He could go for someone much more prettier."" The blond added, then they both left the bathroom leaving Lina to stare at herself in the mirror. She was beautiful... Right? She put her makeup away and stared back up at her reflection. She could see the dim in her eyes and despite telling herself that Roman thought she was beautiful, she still felt ugly after what they said. She was going back to her former self, a woman that rarely dressed up because she was too insecure with her body. She went back out to the table and sat down across from him, the breadsticks were already put out as was the wine. She stared down at her empty plate looking into her reflection. ""What""s wrong baby doll?"" Her eyes snapped up to meet his and she licked her lips. ""Um..."" She forced a smile and giggled nervously, placing her palms flat on the table. ""Nothing. Absolutely nothing."" ""Hmmm."" Her eyes flickered over to across the restaurant, while approaching the table she had seen where the blonde and brunette were sitting.",6234395
2182,"""Do you hear something?"" Then, she heard it too. Violin music. Creepy violin music. To her utter horror, Inu-yasha statred looking for the music""s origin, and he was smiling on top of it. Kagome followed him, till they came to a darkened street corner. Under a lamppost was a solitary man, cloaked in a hat and dark jacket, playing the music. Inu-yasha walked towards him... then... ""Now!"" the man said, flinging his disguise off. He had wild hair, and purple eyes. Then, a horrible hunchback swung a butterfly net on top of Inu-yasha, while a girl with syringe jabbed him in the back. Inu-yasha cried and howled with pain before he dropped to the ground. Kagome rushed over to him, and covered him with her body. ""Don""t you dare hurt him!"" she yelled at the three maniacs. ""He""s my boyfriend!"" ""Boyfriend?"" the hunchback asked. ""Sister, what have you been smoking, and can I have some?"" ""It""s true,"" she said, cradling Inu-yasha""s beautiful white head in her arms, ""He saved my life last night... I love him!"" ""We""re not trying to hurt him, miss,"" the leader of the group said, ""We""re trying to save him."" ""And just who are you, anyway?"" Kagome asked angrily. The young lady grabbed the leader""s arm, and said proudly, ""We""re his parents! I""m Serenity, and this is Dr. Yami Von Yugistein. And the guy looking up your skirt is my brother, Joegore."" Kagome whirled around and slapped her skirt hem away from Joegore""s hands. ""Cut it out, you pervert. Your worse than that officer!"" Kagome yelled. ""Sshhh,"" Yami hushed her. ""We must be quiet about this. If you care for Inu-yasha, then we must get him home."" ""Okay,"" Kagome agreed. She helped them carry Inu-yasha in the waiting cart, where they covered him with hay, and carried him safely back to the castle. Act Five: Scene Six ""Urgh?"" Inu-yasha groaned as he woke up. ""Home?"" He looked up at Kagome, who was standing over him. ""Yes, Inu-yasha,"" Kagome answered, ""You""re home."" ""Home,"" Inu-yasha said dreamily, looking around. ""yeah,"" Kagome said, ""See, here""s Joegore and Serenity, and Dr. Yugistein."" she said, pointing to them all. ""Father!"" Inu-yasha cried happily before he licked Yami with a big slurp. ""Yes, we""re glad to see you, too,"" Yami said, pushing Inu-yasha away. ""Darling,"" Serenity said, ""What are we going do about his brain? He can""t stay a dog forever, no matter how smart or cute he is."" ""You""re right. I have an idea, but it puts both our lives at risk. I shall have to think about it. I""ll have my decision at sunset tomorrow. ""I""d better get going then,"" Kagome said. ""My grandpa already freaked about me and Inu-yasha this morning."" ""Let me get this straight,"" Joegore asked, leaning in and peering at Kagome, ""You and he... And he was good?"" Kagome""s only response was blushing and giggling wildly. Then, Inu-yasha whimpered as he realized that Kagome was leaving. ""Don""t worry,"" Kagome told Inu-yasha, ""I""ll be back tomorrow afternoon. I promise."" Inu-yasha perked up at that, gave her cheek a slurpy lick too. Then, Kagome said her farewells, went home for the night.",512464
1691,"The other princess blushed furiously, and waved her hands frantically. ""N-no you weren""t."" She simply replied. Princess Bubblegum gave a quick glance at Marshall Lee and then walked out of the attic hastily. ""I should probably clear the misunderstanding by now."" She said as she stopped walking by the doorway. ""You are our guest, Marshall Lee."" She added with a small smile and continued walking. Marceline and Marshall Lee nodded in agreement as they floated outside as well. Back at the lobby of the castle, Princess Bubblegum stood in the middle and gathered all the candy people. There, she cleared the confusion Ooo""s hero accidentally did and advised the people to treat Marshall Lee as a ""guest"". ""This may sound a bit ridiculous but with this vampire""s sudden appearance, it gave us a sign that there is another dimension. It""s a scientific break-through and it can benefit us."" Princess Bubblegum said, wherein the candy people sublimely agreed into. The princess smiled and then nodded as she dismissed everyone in the lobby. Everyone walked out, whispering and talking about how caring and amazing their beloved ruler is. Finn and Jake went to the princess""s side. Finn scratched the back of his head shyly. ""Gee, Peebs. I""m really sorry with all the trouble I caused today. I didn""t mean to attack your guest. I just wanted to protect you."" He said, in which Jake hurriedly sided with Finn""s apology. The princess smiled warmly and then patted the young hero""s head. ""I know, and you did a great job."" She said. Just at the moment, the two vampires appeared. Marshall Lee floated towards Princess Bubblegum as he scratched the back of his head. ""I owe you a lot, princess. Thanks for... you know..."" he paused, as he struggled to find the right words to say. Princess Bubblegum simply smiled, and then placed a hand on his shoulder. ""You""re welcome."" She said. Marshall Lee smiled in return, unable to say anything. Jake and Marceline stared at the two for a moment and then looked at each other, as if talking in telepathy. ""Weird, are they getting along?' ""Don""t ask me, I am just his alternate.' ""Finn, I am hosting an afternoon tea party at my garden tomorrow. You think you can come?"" Princess Bubblegum asked, breaking the silence within them. ""What""s the party for?"" Marceline asked instantly. ""It""s more of a welcome party for your alternate."" The princess replied. ""Cool, a party just for me!"" Marshall Lee said with a sheepish grin. Finn rubbed the back of his neck with his gaze averted as he replied. ""Thanks for the invite, princess. But... I kinda made a promise with Flame Princess tomorrow afternoon. You know... a date."" Princess Bubblegum was about to say something, when she realized that there""s no voice coming out from her mouth. She transferred her gaze at the opposite direction and then forced a smile. ""O-oh! Is that so... It""s okay, I understand!"" she said. ""Princess, I-"" ""No really, Finn. You""re Flame Princess""s hero now. She""s your top priority. Always remember that."" She said with a smile as she excused herself and left the lobby.",2750536
2386,"She put white makeup on her face, black around the eyes to make it like a mask, and beat red lipstick. She stepped over to the door and exited the room taking a deep breath and hoping he would enjoy it.

He turns to her, freezing he dropped the plate he had held in his hands, it fell to the ground breaking into pieces. She smirked since he wasn""t particularly a man to surprise easily.

1235,"It makes this sacrifice even easier. I would only be the one to suffer. At least, my sufferings will not be in vain for I know that my country will benefit for it.

In one way or another, I still hope to believe that love isn""t just for the weak. s s Chapter 3 ""Cause we""ll find the way s s It was one of those days when she loved the rain. The droplets of water that pours down her delicate skin felt nice, for one. The gray clouds that hung above her head simply supplemented the way she felt: Hurt, lost, but free. Which is why she could be found standing at the park, her wedding gown soaking wet, her hair dishelmed, a blank expression on her face. The sight of the empty park seemed to content her. It was a rare chance to have this park by yourself. Somehow, she thanked the rain. Nothing could bee seen on her golden orbs... they were lost and even her rational mind couldn""t kick in and advise her to go hide. Hide, you ask? Well, for one, anyone who would find a lady dressed in her wedding gown in a park would definitely brand the scene as ""inconsiderably weird,' which would definitely caused too much attention- Cagalli hated attention. But it wasn""t really the reason for hiding. You see, Cagalli Yula Attha just ditched out her wedding. No one except her friends would understand what she did. Everyone thought she had her mind set. No one thought she would back out. ""I do... not want to marry you.' The words she uttered rang through her ears. She really didn""t know why she backed out. It was as if someone programmed her to say those words. She smiled weakly as she the scene a few minutes ago replayed on her mind. It was nice to run wearing your wedding gown, she learned. Maybe... she could do that again. Right now, nothing mattered to Cagalli. She just felt... free. She made a choice for herself. Then again, she always made decisions for herself. Isn""t the reason why she accepted Yuna""s proposal? To help her country? To decide for the sake of her people? Morally, what she did was wrong but then, some part of her wanted to reconsider the answer. She raised her head and allowed the raindrops to trace her face. She wanted, even just now, to feel at peace and forget all her problems. She never felt this light for a long time. Spending hours on your desk would do that to you. Athrun, it was all Athrun""s fault. Her mind wandered of to a certain blue-haired coordinator. She watched him, from the corner of her eye, as she walked down the isle. The bastard was smiling. If she were normal, Cagalli would have punch the wall that may even result to a crack of some sort.",560480
1863,"Now what I was wondering, is how the hell he knew Haruhi was at my house the other night! Is this guy spying on me? Because I know he didn""t have all these ""close contacts"", he""s speaking of. Nevertheless, I have no choice but to respond. ""Yeah, she was there. Her parents were away, and she needed a place to stay."" I told him, but Taniguchi didn""t really buy it. His face lit up, and he playfully punched me on the shoulder. ""I knew you always liked the weird girls, Kyon! So how far did you get? First base? Now, to something like this, my response might be coated in anger. I might have actually shouted back at Taniguchi not to say such ridiculous things. But this time in the morning, I really didn""t have the energy to get mad at this idiot and his ramblings. So, I sighed, answering him once again. ""She slept on my floor. Nothing happened between us, and I""m not in the mood to talk at the moment."" I told Taniguchi, seeing that the school entrance was just right ahead. I felt a little relief at not having to talk to him any longer, and so without even saying goodbye, I speedily entered the front doors, running up nearby stairs that led to my class. Like my Sunday, the school day was just as boring and uneventful. I managed to get to my seat in class a little early, but upon arriving, I noticed Haruhi wasn""t in her usual seat yet. So, I sat and waited, but still, she didn""t arrive. Finally, about 3 minutes before the start of class, Haruhi came in, not even giving me a word as she sat in her chair and buried her head in her arms. I thought of possibly saying something to her, but class had already begun by then, so I turned around and attempted to pay attention. At lunchtime, I headed down to the clubroom as usual. Upon entering, I noticed something that to me was quite strange. There wasn""t anyone there. It surprised me, mostly because the clubroom was always occupied by at least one person during the lunch period. But alas, it was not this time. So, I went off to go eat lunch by myself, attempting to avoid Taniguchi and Kunikida, so neither of them would bother me about Haruhi spending the night at my house on Saturday. Even though I say nothing about certain things, everyone seems to find about them somehow. I really get annoyed by that. After more agonizing hours of class, the school day finally came to an end. Now came the part of my day where I was to go to the clubroom and partake in the daily activities that the SOS Brigade had to offer. Well, you could say ""activities"", if you were talking about being bossed around by Haruhi, or listening to another one of Koizumi""s long speeches about some obscure theory. Or drinking Asahina-san""s amazingly brewed tea, which isn""t such a bad thing. Upon my arrival to the clubroom, I found a strange sight as before. When I opened the door, I could clearly see only three members were present. Yuki Nagato was doing the same thing she did almost every single club meeting. She was silently reading a book, sitting on a metal fold-up chair in the corner. It was interesting to note I barely ever see her blink.",967934

""You ordered the Venti to attack us!"" The men on either side of her put their hands on their own swords and started to step forward, but Aitna halted them with a raise of her hand. ""Yes. I had to get you here."" ""To hand us over to Gaea."" It wasn""t a question, so Jason was surprised when she answered in the negative. ""No."" ""Wait, you mean you don""t work for Gaea?"" Leo asked, clearly just as flummoxed as Jason. ""Then why-"" ""You misunderstand me. Of course I work for Gaea; she is my mother, and unlike those arrogant gods the rightful ruler of this world. I only meant you two shall not be handed over to her. Your friends will be."" Jason had had enough of this, and that was all he needed to hear. He charged towards her. This time she didn""t stop the two men from leaping to her aid. They met Jason""s sword with a thunderous clash. After only a few moments of fighting, Jason knew that these men were not fighters. Their technique was sloppy. They were slow and appeared untrained. Still, both were much stronger than him, and of course there were two of them. Despite this, he had no doubt he could beat them given enough time. ""STOP!"" Aitna shouted from where she was standing. The two men immediately lowered their weapons and stood at attention. Jason paused for a moment, but not one to waste an opportunity, he stepped forward, intending to stab one through the joints of his armor, but Aitna started talking again. ""You, son of Jupiter, sheath your sword, or you will never see your friends again!"" ""You already admitted that you""re going to give them to Gaea!"" Jason shouted angrily, but he stopped his advance. ""Yes, but I can just as easily have them killed. It""s true that my patron would prefer them alive, but she will understand that in the heat of battle it""s hard to control who lives and dies. She will be content just knowing that they are no longer a thorn in her side."" ""What do you want?"" Jason asked, helplessly. ""I want to see the gods suffer! I want to see your fathers kneel before me and beg for my forgiveness!"" ""Forgiveness?"" Leo asked, mystified. Jason couldn""t blame him because he was feeling the same way. What had their fathers ever done to her? ""You two will spend the war in my dungeons. I will tell my mother that you perished in battle. You will remain alive and safe until both your fathers are chained before me. Then I will kill you in from of them."" ""Oh, is that all?"" Leo muttered. Jason was thinking about the name Aitna again... He couldn""t help feeling like there was some other important factor that he was missing. ""You... supported the gods in the first titan war..."" he said slowly, gauging her reaction to see if he was correct. She turned a shade of purplish-red. ""And look where it got me!"" she screeched, gesturing wildly to the room. Well. At he knew he was right. Aitna continued. ""I gave up everything to help those selfish, ungrateful pigs!",2943978
561,"""I""m just stopping by to thank you personally for all of the GCPD""s hard work at solving the Wayne murders,"" he announced in his ""I""m a politician"" voice. He extended a hand to her, and she shook it firmly, aware that her glass-sided office was the attention of the entire department. ""Thank you. The GCPD is grateful for your appreciation."" In some cities, getting a personal visit from the mayor would have been a form of a compliment. In places like Metropolis and Star City, the police captain would have been ordered to report to the mayor""s office as a sign that the mayor had them at his beck and call. In Gotham, the mayor dropped by unannounced as a reminder that he was always watching and could do whatever he wanted. Mayor James sat on the edge of her desk in a seemingly casual move, gesturing for her to resume her seat. She obeyed without comment, tired of the pettiness of politicians in general and this one in particular. Sarah Essen knew how Gotham worked, and didn""t need to be reminded by constant slights and putdowns by those further up the ladder. ""There was some talk going around that the Gordon boy was saying Pepper was set up,"" he said conversationally. ""He""s still a rookie,"" she said. ""He""s learning the program."" ""I would hate for the rumor mill to start believing that the Waynes"" murderer is still out there."" ""It was open and shut. Pepper was found with Martha Wayne""s pearls in his possession, and ran when the police tried to arrest him."" ""Good, good."" Sarah wasn""t foolish to believe the flash of Mayor James""s teeth was a smile. ""Falcone""s got some residual fondness for the Gordon family, but that""s not going to be enough if Gordon gets in his way."" ""He""ll learn,"" she repeatedly, disgusted as she realized why Mayor James had chosen today for one of his unscheduled visits. Falcone may have played the respectable businessman, but he was smart enough to work behind the scenes. Sarah had met him once in passing, since he certainly wasn""t going to be stopping by the station in person to relay a message. ""See that he does,"" Mayor James replied, before clasping her on the shoulder in an overly familiar fashion. ""The Arkham project is coming before the council, and we can""t afford any distractions from having any outstanding business get in the way."" ""That""s still on the table?"" She asked in spite of herself. ""Without Thomas Wayne..."" ""We""ll have a nice plaque installed as memorial once the project is done. The Arkham project won""t be stopped just because of the death of two people, even if they were the ones behind it."" He straightened and stepped back from the desk. ""The City of Gotham has to do something with Arkham, and it""s up to us to carry on."" He gave her another long, knowing look, before heading out of her office. She watched the door shut with a quiet click, and listened as the noise in the bullpen returned to its usual levels as her crew got back to business as usual. It had been lucky Gordon had been gone during Mayor James""s visit.",1112924
1486,"Since she""s not sure what she wants the answer to be, Emma smiles and lets him interpret it as he will. She doesn""t need to make this decision yet. She has more immediate concerns - like a son who is insistent in believing in fairy tales. Emma Swan finds the attempts to teach her to appreciate ""culture"" a joke. She doesn""t plan on doing anything with culture in her life, since culture doesn""t want to do anything for her. She""s fifteen and cynical when she attends the performance of Peter Pan with her English class. Her teacher made them read the book and watch the cartoon version, and now they""re going to have to suffer through a play. It""s some kind of Bull Crap Arts Program sponsored by Elitist Snobs Who Think Art Is Going To Fix Everything. Emma would rather go to school, because at least there she can cut her classes without anyone looking for her. She""s been assigned Jillian Gutzman as a ""buddy,"" and Jillian""s nose is so brown that Emma can smell the shit ten feet away. She squirms in her seat, a captive audience for the matinee performers. The only thing that""s cool is watching the actors get into the harnesses to ""fly"" on stage about fifteen feet off the ground. Everything else sucks. She""s confused as to why anyone would believe that the woman - there""s no mistaking the curve of her chest or hips when she stands at an angle - is a preteen boy. Later on her English teacher will force them to watch the old film starring Mary Martin in order to prepare their compare-and-contrast essays, and she""ll think it""s even more ridiculous that the tradition of the theater is to shove middle-aged women into Peter Pan""s tights. The story is boring, and she feels zero empathy for any of the cast. The Darlings are privileged brats, and Peter Pan is an idiot for wanting to be an orphan. Her disbelief doesn""t suspend, and she spends the rest of the time picking the play to bits in her head, even as Jillian makes the audience-appropriate reaction sounds like she""s reading stage cues from the script. Emma yawns as Tinker Bell saves Wendy, and can""t bring herself to care as Peter tries to save his fairy friend. The rest of the audience is clapping Tinker Bell back to life, but Emma doesn""t bother to lift her hands. This is stupid, she thinks. It""s just a light pointer and some bad sound effects. Jillian spends half the bus ride home asking why Emma had to be such a spoilsport, causing Emma to grit her teeth for a good twenty minutes before the girl""s whining gets to her. Emma finally snaps and tells Jillian that they""re too old to believe in fairy tales, and it""s no wonder nobody likes her because everyone thinks she""s a baby. Jillian thankfully shuts up, and Emma indulges in her own sense of vindictive satisfaction. Ruby is good at her job. It""s Emma that who is a horrible patron. There""s nothing Ruby does that Emma doesn""t inadvertently screw up. When she ends up wearing her hot chocolate for the third time in a week, Ruby is already there to take care of things. ""Here,"" Ruby says, leaning over and wiping a rag to soak up the spilled liquid.",1112924
252,"""May I leave herr? Officer Hetz will be expecting me."" ""Ja, you can leave."" He watched her as she walked away, devoting her face to his memory. A couple weeks passed where she would see him around the office, this time he would sneak glances at her, she would never notice. One day Hetz called her in to his office, probably to make obscene remarks about her appearance. She entered without a word and sat down across from him, he was reading a letter. It was yanked open, his eyes narrowed on her after a moment. ""Do you know why I called you in?"" ""No, herr. Do you need me to bring anything to anyone? Have you finally been promoted?"" She had heard recently that the Lieutenant General was looking for an Officer that would work closely under him. Much closer than Hetz was at the moment. ""That""s the problem."" She frowned as he placed the letter down before her. ""You must have been sucking the right dicks."" He mumbled in an irate manner, his teeth ground together and his brow raised. Her mouth opened an closed, she didn""t know what to say and shakily placed a hand over the letter. She slid it over to herself and lifted it up. It read: Officer Taryn Hetz, It has caught my eye that there is a great amount of dedication and skill in your department. I have reassigned Nya Fateze as my First Officer. She should be assigned a day from now to her new position. Lieutenant General Johann Schmidt Terse, to the point, no explanation. She was shocked. She was surprised. Speechless. She looked back up at Hetz. Red. Angrier than she had ever seen him before. ""You little cunt!"" He snarled, her eyes widened and she vigorously shook her head. ""No herr. I would never-"" ""What a whore!"" He stood up abruptly, slamming his hands flat against the desk. Tears brimmed her eyes, I stood up and threw the letter down. ""I will not accept this. I shall go to the Lieutenant now."" She wanted to accept it, she really did, but Hetz hated being second best. She made her way to the door, but somehow the universe wasn""t kind enough. His hand smashed into the door beside her head, holding it shut. ""It would make no difference. No woman will best me, there is only one way to put you in your place."" She backed away, he stepped closer. He swung his hand across her cheek and she fell onto the floor from the force behind it. She was no weak woman, merely soft and gentle. But certainly not fragile. There was a knock at the door to Hetz"" office, he grabbed her forearm and pulled her as she held a hand over her eye. He slapped the hand away and forcefully wiped the tears that slid down her cheeks. ""Officer."" The loud voice of a superior echoed on the other side of the door. ""Please come in."" The door opened and Schmidt walked in, Nya narrowed her eyes to the floor she could not bare to meet his gaze. Schmidt looked between Hetz and her, his hat held tightly under his arm. Hetz gave him a convincing smile and assumed a stance of authority. ""Herr, so great that you took the time to see me."" ""Of course, you called for me saying that it was urgent.""",6234395
1698,"Landing on the floor with a loud thump, TK gave a thumbs up as the ball bounced right past him, ""Got canned heat in my heels tonight, baby!"" Fujimaki looked to his side as he sat up, only to spot the basketball rolling along. He couldn""t help but sigh as he picked it up and put it under his arm. Losing in basketball to TK...this was nothing new. It only annoyed him a little bit that two-on-one he still couldn""t be beaten, and Ooyama seemed to prove useless time and time again. ""Well...you""re right on the heels part...but this guy can""t play to save his life! Man up a little and block him, why don""t you?"" Fujimaki told Ooyama, who just seemed to shake in fear. ""I didn""t mean to panic! He""s so fast! What did you expect me to do?"" ""I expect you to win!"" ""Alright, alright calm down. I didn""t stay here late so I could watch you two argue."" Matsushita, known around the school as Matsushita 5th Dan, interjected as he stepped down from the bleachers. It was after school hours now, and after four o""clock, the gym was solely reserved for usage by the basketball club. The basketball club, formed by TK, was made up of only five members. Besides TK, they included Fujimaki, Ooyama, Matsushita, and a boy named Takeyama, who was always busy on the bleachers with his laptop. He hated being called Takeyama, and insisted that everyone in the club call him ""Christ"". They seldom did so, however. Matsushita was only in the club as a favor to TK, since the club would have failed approval if it didn""t have at least five members. In reality, Matsushita was always busy with Judo club, though he would come to watch them play when had the time. In short, these five were TK""s only friends. They were the only ones he hung out with after school, and they were the only people that understood him and his mannerisms the most. They were also the ones who lost to him in basketball on a daily basis. None of them liked it much, especially Fujimaki, who would rather blame Ooyama constantly than admit his own shortcomings. ""It""s cool. Give peace a chance."" TK remarked as he put both arms around Fujimaki and Ooyama in a friendly manner. Fujimaki seemed to shrug him away, his face still clearly annoyed over TK""s usual basketball victory. ""Peace is irrelevant."" Takeyama said from one of the low bleachers, his fingers moving like lightning across his laptop keyboard. Matsushita merely sighed in response to Takeyama""s comment. He really should have been training more right now, but something about TK and his basketball games always seemed to take Matsushita away from his training. ""Whatever. TK wins, we lose. Tomorrow, we do it all over again."" Fujimaki said in a somewhat defeated voice. He knew being pissed off about something like this would be useless at this point. It""s not like he didn""t have enough people in this school who were afraid of him. Nevertheless, he wished that he could beat TK one of these days, with or without Ooyama""s help. ""Hey...look over there."" Ooyama stated as he pointed up towards the bleachers.",967934
3520,"..... Getting into that hospital had been absolute hell. Getting in there with a vial of Pishsalver had been even harder, he recalled. He""d had to drink about half the contents to get it in there in the first place. Thankfully, she really was insane enough to drink it herself. Her getting out by herself had been an added bonus...though the rag-dress didn""t do her much justice, he thought. After that, she""d toppled right down the hole. Maybe madness wasn""t all bad. Thankfully, getting back to his original size was easy. After he""d chewed the corner off of one of the cakes, he""d broken off a piece and stuffed a little bit of the Upelkuchen in her mouth as well and dragged her through the door. After that, she was on her own. Her unnamed hero looked at her one last time before disappearing never to be seen again. His part in the Oraculum was done...now, it was up to either Tarrant Hightopp or Ilosovic Stayne to find her. The one last thing he did was put her into a new hospital uniform. It would have to do for now. .... Ilosovic Stayne had just finished studying the Oraculum and sent out both of the hounds to hunt for the girls. One of them was Alice, the one who was supposed to kill the Jabberwocky and bring the White Queen back to power. The other one, the one that no one had seemed to notice, was the Black Queen. The Black Queen was the lost sister of Mirana and Iracebeth. The Black Queen was supposed to take over Iracebeth""s throne and help the White Queen rule. If Iracebeth hadn""t been yelling so much about her stupid tarts and yelling about Alice, she might have noticed that she""d have a replacement. Stayne himself was the only one who had noticed-he couldn""t complain. But the sooner he nipped this problem in the bud, the better. A third queen would complicate things considerably. His horse trotted through the woods with the playing card guards clanking along beside him. They all jumped when they heard a horrendous shriek. He""d know that sound anywhere... It was a Jubjub bird. He drew his sword as they prepared to deal with the nasty creature. What they weren""t prepared for was what the bird was trying to catch. A girl in a gray uniform was running towards the woods where she would be better protected. Her shirt had almost been torn to ribbons and bloody gashes shone on her back. She was trying to escape the bird and seemed to be tiring out. He saw the raven curls and commanded his soldiers to dispatch the bird. Since birds don""t eat metal, they drove it away fairly quickly. He approached the fallen girl. She was turning pale from blood loss. He lifted her weight of one-hundred-ninety-six pounds as if she weighed nothing and slung her over the horse""s back. They had found the Black Queen. A plan was formulating in his mind as they raced back to the castle. If he could keep her identity a secret from Iracebeth, maybe she""d return the favor and let him have some of the resulting power from Iracebeth being defeated. The girl had a look of madness about her, but it wasn""t the same scary power-hungry madness as Iracebeth.",870118
1853,"Smiling through his massive canines as he looked at his new prize, George took one last look at Felix and Flo, before he continued his climb, with Sergeant Calhoun trapped in its unbreakable grip. ""No, no, no! That""s my date, you big monkey!"" Felix yelled in frustration, before turning back to Flo, who was still reeling in shock. ""You moved your restaurant into Rampage? What were you thinking?!"" he exclaimed, but Flo seemed to be in too much shock to give him much of a response. Clearly, she wouldn""t be much help. But as he turned around, he could see both Ulala and Beat, who besides himself and Flo, hadn""t run off in fear. ""Need some help? It""s been ages since we""ve been able to do something exciting."" Beat remarked. Ulala stood right by the skater, microphone in hand and her expression telling Felix that she was with him as well. Pulling out his hat and putting it on, Felix looked ahead at the destruction before him and then back at his new allies. Hammer suddenly in hand, he nodded back at them. ""Yeah, looks like I""m going to need all the help I can get. "" he told them, before leaping out of the side of the building with the two of them right behind him. Suddenly, the chase was on, as Felix, Beat and Ulala scaled the side of the building together, while Flo stayed behind. She could only shake her head in sadness, dreading at the thought of how she""d ever be able to keep a business in a game like this. ""We""re coming for you, Ms. Calhoun."" Felix shouted defiantly, even though the monstrous ape was indeed far ahead of them. But he was indeed coming for her, no matter what. He was the hero of his game for a reason, after all. Now it was time for him to truly prove it. Ah, another chapter coming your way, people! This one was particularly fun to write. Oh, and despite the end of this chapter, more is coming! Read, review, enjoy, and stay tuned! Even thought her fists were quite tiny and insignificant when compared to such a massive creature, Sergeant Calhoun still could not help but at least attempt to break free. After all, her programming dictated that she could face Cy-Bugs and the like head on without so much as a shudder, so a giant ape shouldn""t be this much of a problem for her. ""No way I""m going down like some two-bid damsel in distress! Now let go of me so I can properly thank you for making this entire night a complete headache!"" she demanded, but George ignored her pleas as he continued to scale the side of the building. Every time he grabbed hold of another series of windowsills in an effort to pull himself, concrete crumbled from the side of the building. It seemed like it could come down at any moment. Not used to being completed ignored, the Sergeant just kept on struggling, even though in the back of her mind she was sure her efforts were completely in vain. Now all she could do was wonder how Felix could possibly get her out of this predicament... The trademark noise of his jumping, along with the sound of sparks flying as Ulala hitched a ride on the back of the grinding Beat, marked the approach of Felix and his allies.",967934
2376,"""That was for Gem,"" Leaf said, ""If you""re going to travel with us, then you have to understand that Gem can""t speak; she""s mute. And only Magnus and I can hear her thoughts. It""s a half-elf thing."" ""And this is our leader?"" the spoiled prince outraged, ""A mute princess? I was better off with the prospect of dying in the desert! At least then my death would have meant something!"" Orson stopped, drew his sword, and cried, ""That does it! Magnus, draw your sword! We""re goin"" at it right now!"" ""I""m not a soldier,"" Magnus said, ""I won""t fight you. Besides, I don""t have a sword."" Beside him, Gem growled, and drew her own, stepping up to Orson""s challenge. ""Oh, the little quiet girl""s gonna fight me. I""m so scared."" ""You should be,"" Magnus and Leaf said at the same time, for then, Gemini charged, and with one quick strike, disarmed Prince Orsonwith the point of her sword. ""Okay!"" Orson cried, ""I really am scared! Put your sword away!"" Gem sheathed her blade, then Magnus and Leaf both stepped up to Orson and both said, ""Do not tempt me again, for next time, treaty or no, I will have your life. Your mother will deal with me as she sees fit."" ""The sun is getting low,"" Greebus said. ""We need to make camp for the night."" They dropped their gear and weapons on the ground- marking where they would sleep- unrolled blankets and built a cook fire to roast their dried meats and stale bread. The night had grown cold, as cold as the day had been sweltering, and the wind blew spurts of sand around and in the camp, getting into the company""s eyes, ears, noses, and everywhere else. One consolation was the softness of the sand as they lay to sleep. All slept heavily, except the Princess and her body guard. Gem walked over to where Magnus kept watch for the night. ""Are you tired?' she asked him. ""Not really,' he answered, ""My mother""s kind don""t need much sleep. Thanks for defending me, by the way.' ""No one, even a prince, has the right to insult either myself or those I love,' she said, laying her head on his shoulder. ""Are you sure of your feelings for me, Princess?' Magnus asked, ""We""ve only known each other for a short time.' ""I""ve never been more sure of anything in my life,' she said. ""I love you Magnus, and I want you to stay with me.' Behind the couple, a solitary sniff, and a heart that ached with bitter sorrow lay listening with his mind. His secret power hidden from even the strongest magic wielders. Suddenly, cracks in the earth opened, and sand began to pour into the cracks. The breaks widened, and long, clawed hands reached up for the surface. Their master spoke to them through the wind, ""Kill the others, but leave the Princess alive.' ""Magnus!' Gem said, pointing to the hands, ""Do you see that?' ""I do!' he said, drawing his dagger. He leaped to his feet, and yelled, ""Alarm! Alarm!"" The others jumped up from their slumber, grabbing their weapons (or looking for a hiding place in a certain Grass Runner""s case) and they stood together, to face the creatures under the burning sands. The monsters that arose were gruesome indeed.",512464
2031,"They sat only a few inches away from each other; something which Yuuki had noticed quickly, as opposed to Switch, who seemed to remain oblivious to the fact. Their closeness was only made more awkward by the fact the room was basically pitch black save for the light of the movie. [Such shoddy camera work. I wonder how many awards they expect to win with a cameraman like that.] Switch criticized. Yuuki""s response was as quick as a bullet. ""That was done on purpose. Not everything needs to be about perfection. These scenes show the utter terror that these people are going through. How I wish I could be in there place..."" [People? Don""t you mean actors?

Screams and shuffling came from the television as Yuuki and Switch continued their dialogue. [These things can be easily reproduced. Anyone can walk into the forest and fake a paranormal situation. This argument is useless. The questions you should really be asking yourself are the ones that have to do with you owning this film in the first place.

Soon they will lose something far more precious than a simple map..."" Switch""s speedy typing was loud enough that it managed to drown out some of the crackling noises coming from the movie. [I""m just so afraid! You know, when I came here to experience the occult, I did not think it would be so uneventful. This is not very impressive, Yuuki-san. Not impressive at all.] Frustrated beyond words, Yuuki reached for the remote on top of the dresser before quickly lowering the movie""s volume. Her face seemed full of distress as she turned towards Switch. ""Here we are again. I see what is happening here.

2937,"Amber raised an eyebrow at him, still waiting for her brother to finish. James sighed as he walked back inside his room, gesturing his sister to come in as well. Amber entered his room and glanced around. She was a bit surprised that Sofia wasn""t inside. James sat on the couch with his back slumped. Amber sat beside him as well. ""Where""s Sofia?"" she asked. ""Back in her room. We just got home."" He replied. Amber nodded, her grip on her fan tightened a bit. ""Did something happen?"" she asked again. ""No, nothi-"" ""Last night?"" Amber added, adding more stress to her question. James stiffened with his gaze casted down. His twin sister""s gaze was getting intense, not taking her eyes off him. He clenched his fists on his lap as he slowly nodded to his sister""s question. Amber gasped slightly, and then placed a hand on his back. James glanced at her with a small smile on his lips. ""Don""t worry. I""m sure everything""s going to work out just fine."" He said. Despite his words, Amber could feel that James is pretty unsure himself. Back in Sofia""s room, the brunette princess was changing her clothes since the one she wore last night was still a bit soaked. After dressing up, she brushed her hair. Looking in the mirror, she remembered every detail of what happened last night. And just by thinking about it still makes her as flustered as ever. Yesterday night felt like forever, she thought. She placed her brush down and stood up, feeling a bit sad. Today, she won""t be seeing James that much since he was preparing for his fiancé""s visit. Though she already told herself that this kind of thing inevitable, it still hurts that she can""t be with the person she loves. But James did promise that everything would be alright. And she knows that James wouldn""t break his promise. It""s all according to destiny, she told herself. All of a sudden, she heard a faint knock on her door. Hastily, she walked towards it and opened to reveal her half-sister. Amber smiled at Sofia slightly and grabbed her wrist gently. ""Breakfast is served and you are being summoned by dad. Let""s go?"" Amber said. Sofia returned her smile and gave her a small nod. ""Okay."" The two princesses walked down the hallway in silence, wherein usually they would chat until they reach the dining area. Sofia had her gaze down when Amber glanced at her. She gave out a small sigh and then stopped walking. This made Sofia stop as well as she turned back to face her step-sister. With a concerned expression on her face, Sofia walked towards Amber. ""Is there something wrong?"" she asked. Amber glanced at her and held both of her hands. ""Sofia, James told me what happened yesterday."" She said, her voice sincere and her eyes staring at Sofia""s. The brunette princess loosened her grip on Amber""s hands as she casted her head down. ""Is it bad?"" Sofia asked meekly. Amber shook her head and smiled at her sister. ""No it""s not. But... with James"" fiancé just around the corner, don""t you think that... it""ll be hard for you both?"" Sofia kept her gaze on the carpeted floor, as if it was the most interesting thing in the world.",2750536
1220,"""It was because of Genesis..."" Sometimes I wonder how life could have turned out if the war didn""t ensue. Maybe I haven""t met Athrun. Maybe I""m still self-centered. Maybe I""m still that spoiled tomboyish princess. What could have happened if Athrun didn""t have amnesia? Will we live happily ever after like in fairy tales? Will you really be my prince charming that will save me from all these miseries? You don""t know the pain, Athrun. You don""t experience the pain of having the person you ever loved stay beside you only to know that he couldn""t remember you at all. But you don""t need to remember me, just staying beside me is enough. Asking for your memories to come back is already too much. What is important is that you are alive. You still have time to acquire new memories. But you could never rebuild the special memories that we had. ""Athrun, I want you to make new memories... happy memories."" He looked at me quizzically and so I continued. ""You may never recover your memories, right? So just make new ones, okay? I want you to promise me that."" ""You""ll help me, right?"" Athrun... why are you making this hard for me? I smiled bitterly, ""I will, of course."" I could help you gain new memories, Athrun... but only as friends. We could never restore the relationship we had. I opened my bag and fished a white envelope. With a shaking hand, I gave it to Athrun. He took it curiously and read it silently. He was surprised after reading the letter, ""You are going to be married to Yuna Roma Seirin tomorrow!"" ""Yes..."" Athrun smiled happily. ""That""s quite sudden but it is okay. Best Wishes, then!"" I could feel my heart being torn into pieces as you smiled. How could you smile, Athrun? I couldn""t take it anymore. ""How could you smile, Athrun?"" I whispered bitterly. I faced him, my tears flowed freely. ""Are you happy that I am going to be married to someone other than you? For goodness gracious! This is no joke, Athrun! I am going to be Mrs. Seirin tomorrow! and yet you are happy! How could you do this to me!"" I started hitting him but he was stronger than me. In a few seconds he caught both my wrists. ""Let me go! I said let me go!"" ""Cagalli-san, you""re hurting yourself! Please stop!"" ""LET GO OF ME!"" He suddenly pulled me into his embrace, my tears soaked his shirt. I cried uncontrollably. Athrun, how could you do this to me? Why are you doing this to me? ""You said you""ll protect me... you said you loved me! But how could you do this to me, Athrun!"" ""Cagalli-san! Please stop!"" ""Why are you letting me go...?"" When I realized how much I loved Athrun, I dreamed of being wedded to him. I imagined him to wear a tuxedo and I will wear a beautiful green gown. I imagined that the church will be decorated with beautiful flowers and that all my friends would be our witnesses. But everything will remain a dream. I should have known that he will not stop me from marrying Yuna, he forgot me already, isn""t? I should have known that he""ll never love me the same way he did before. I could never understand the weather.",560480
961,"Pierre bowed and wished her a goodnight, then left her there, to be alone with the ghost of Erik""s voice, and ponder at the sudden realization that she really had fallen in love with the man in mask. Note I own nothing. Please review, it helps me know if I""m doing good or not. Sorry, my Phantom fans, for the long wait. I""ve had school and several other projects eating my time, and I have only just gotten inspired to write on this because I bought the movie soundtrack. So, enjoy. Chapter Six: Giving Account Five evenings later, when another performance had come and gone, the three sat in the silence of the front room, Celeste replacing a broken string, Erik going over the next performance""s score, and Pierre fiddling with one of his drum sticks. As the rain fell down heavily outside, Pierre had a thought. ""Celeste,"" he said, ""I recall that you once said we needed to start our friendships with the tellings of our pasts, yes?"" Celeste looked at him from her work. Erik""s back stiffened. ""Yes,"" Celeste said. ""I did."" ""Then perhaps our friendship hasn""t truly began, since I still know nothing of the two of you, and you nothing of me?"" Pierre suggested. ""You""re right,"" Celeste said, forming her own idea. Maybe this was a way of getting the truth form Erik. She set her violin on the table and turned to Erik. ""Maybe you could go first, Master Erik? Perhaps you can begin our night of stories?"" Erik put the sheet music down a moment to answer, ""There is nothing to tell. I was born, hated, given away to Gypsies, and treated like a dog until by good fortune I came here."" Celeste was disappointed, but Pierre picked up the slack, saying, ""Then I shall go next. Well, in all honesty my life was quite dull. I lived in the French countryside with my mother until I began writing songs and short stories when I was ten years old. My mother was convinced that I was destined to be the next Amadeus Mozart, so she put back enough money to send me here when I turned fifteen. The theatre was not in need of a composer, but I didn""t want to dissappoint Mother... Now I play percussion."" ""Hardly page turning suspense,"" Erik muttered. ""Well, I think you told it beautifully,"" Celeste said to her young friend. ""What about you, Miss Celeste?"" Pierre asked eagerly. Celeste""s eyes went a little wide. She hadn""t thought about telling her life""s story. She would have kept silent, too, but Erik had other plans. ""Indeed, what about you?"" Erik asked. ""You seem so eager for stories, let""s have yours."" Celeste gulped nervously, and looked around to her companions"" faces. ""Very well. But..."" she dreaded this, but knew no way to explain her life without it, ""But in order to fully understand, I need to begin with another tale."" ""Really?"" Erik asked skepticly. ""Is it about your parents?"" Pierre asked excitedly. ""Yes,"" Celeste said slowly. ""Yes it is."" Celeste""s Narration The truth is I""ve never been entirely sure of the truth. My father used to put me to sleep with his version, for he made it sound like a fairy tale, but my stepmother told me another version after father""s death.",512464
529,"Both leaned in very slowly until their lips were a centimeter away. It stayed like this for a moment, until Mark finally moved in and gave her a quick peck. They pulled away with matching blushes painted on their cheeks. Mark cleared his throat and looked up at everyone. ""My turn! Alright, Josh, truth or dare?"" Josh smirked. He got this. ""Truth."" ""Okay, ummm... if you could date anyone here, who would it be?"" Skye, who was drawing patterns in the dirt, instantly looked up. ""Can you ask me something else?"" Josh asked. ""Nope."" ""Fine."" Then he muttered something incomprehensible. ""Sorry? Didn""t catch that,"" Mark said, cupping a hand around his ear. ""Who?"" ""Can I just tell you?"" ""Alright, alright,"" Mark rolled his eyes. Josh leaned in and whispered the name. ""Holy SHIT man! Seriously?"" Mark""s eyes widened as they moved apart. ""You better not tell!"" Josh said. ""Pinky promise?"" he held out his pinky like a child. ""Pink promise,"" Mark agreed, and they linked pinkies. Lily rolled her eyes. Because pinky promises were just the strongest vow you could ever make. SO. Who do you think Josh wants to date?... ;) Reviews are love! XX. Landon Liboiron... *drools* Oh! Hey there, didn""t see you. So as of now, I""m only writing light and funny episodes, but every now and then I""ll have a serious, angsty, passionate chapter. Yeah? Yeah! Happy reading :) It was a very hectic afternoon in the Shannon household. Cries of ""I can""t find my tie!"" (Jim), ""My hair looks like shite."" (Elisabeth), ""Mommy, have you seen Bobby the dinosaur?"" (Zoe), ""Dad, can I use your cologne?"" (Josh), and best of all: ""Josh, quit hogging the hair dryer, I""m not done with it yet! Mom, Dad, I just can""t go out there, not like this! What if Mark sees me? I look like a whale right now!"" (Maddy) were echoing throughout the tiny house with surprising volume. People were darting in and out of rooms, hurriedly tucking in shirts or brushing hair. All this trouble for a family picture. ""Josh, you said Lily was on her way?"" Elisabeth said as Josh passed by his parent""s bedroom. ""Um."" ""Don""t tell me you forgot!"" Elisabeth shrieked. ""I didn""t forget?"" ""Rrrggh!"" Elisabeth threw a mascara bottle at him. ""Go and pick her up this instant, Josh!"" ""Okay, okay!"" Josh raised his hands in defense and walked away. He squinted as he stepped out into the sunlight, the brightness temporarily blinding him. He got strange looks from passerby and managed a wave. He couldn""t blame them, though; who wore fancy white collared shirts and dress pants in a place like Terra Nova? Best thing about Terra Nova? Everything was located in one place. Josh reached Lily""s house in less than ten minutes. ""He-llo, Mr. Fancy!"" Lily exclaimed when she opened the door. ""Right out of GQ."" ""Ha, ha,"" Josh rolled his eyes. GQ- ugh. ""Yeah, so my mom wants you to be in our family picture. Can you come over real quick?"" ""But I""m not a Shannon..."" Josh laughed. ""Are you kidding? You""ve known me and my family since you were born and you practically live at my house. As far as we""re concerned, you""re a Shannon."" Lily digested this thought.",2855986
1837,"Alucard remained completely silent. A sly grin etched on his features. In his own mind, he was getting revenge on the cabal of vampires who put him on the throne in the first place. He was the goddamn Sacred Ancestor. There were no predecessors to him; answerable to no one and about as vile as they came. He was violent, sado-masochistic, misogynistic, racist, jealous and proud of it. He was a petty, unjust, unforgiving control freak with homophobic, genocidal, filicidal, capriciously malevolent tendencies. And he was also a bully. If he could get away with it, he would feed the same poison to everyone in the audience and then see how they cheered. But then there would be nobody to glorify him. A new creature stepped on stage and joined the youth with a spider head sticking out of his gut. This was a tall, feminine shape with the bald head of a vulture. Pulling out two stands of silver coated barbed wire, the Vulture-woman and the Spider-boy each grabbed a strand and started to use it to floss the crotch of a female vampire that Seras did not recognize. Her features were turning green; she was going to be sick. The female vampire shrieked as her labia and clitoris was shredded like sliced meat by the back and forth motion of silver coated razor wire. Jan was really getting frantic now. He was threatening and crying like a baby in equal turns. Approaching him was bandaged figure which dripped slime from under his mummy like wrappings and cradles a purring chainsaw in its mottled, deformed hands. Seras couldn""t watch anymore and went to leave since she would play no greater part in this satanic farce. She sprinted down the deserted hallways, realizing now was her time to flee. The prospect of freedom was terrifying. There was nowhere to go and no time to pack anything of significance before Alucard""s address of his people was over. That was when the first explosion happened. She didn""t see it but she felt it. Somewhere in Alucard""s underground lair, a bomb went off and it caused shockwaves through the place. The rumble in the floor caused Seras to trip and fall. Shocked by the fall, Seras dimly was aware of when the Jackal fell from her hidden holster and slid across the floor. While she wasn""t willing to wait for time to pick up any of her good, Seras wasn""t going to leave without her gun. More shockwaves rocked everything and caused dust to fall from the ceiling. A hundred pound chunk of concrete fell from the ceiling but Seras easily knocked it aside. Grabbing her weapon from the floor, Seras began to run with increased urgency. Behind her, explosions tore apart the hallway. She felt the heat of the flames and knew that she didn""t want to be anywhere near here if one of those explosions went off near Alucard""s central armoury. Distant bombs detonating went off and caused Seras""s sensitive vampire ears to ring-then she hit something hard and unyielding. Falling backwards, Seras drew her gun and aimed it at whatever or whoever she""d run into. Dust had fallen into her eyes and as she tried to blink it out, she heard a voice.",1220273
1959,"Without a moment to spare she immediately pricked Jake with it, and ran it across her tongue, then doing the same to me. I barely cringed from the pain. I was used to sharp needles, I had used them a lot in my past. ""Why did you come to us,"" she asked loudly for everyone to hear. ""We came to learn,"" I mutter from beside him now as she looked at me. ""We have tried to teach all the Sky People. It is hard to fill a cup which is already full,"" Tsahik answered for us looking between Jake and I. ""Well my cup is empty. Trust me. Just ask Mia here, or Dr. Augustine. I""m no scientist,"" Jake chuckled looking between the Na""vi woman and me. ""Trust me, he needs to learn more than anyone,"" I told her truthfully crossing my arms as my pop-star attitude began to show. ""What are you,"" she asked looking at Jake. ""I was a Marine. A, uh, warrior, of the Jarhead clan,"" my brother answered dumbly, as he tried showing off. ""A warrior. I could kill him easily,"" Tsu""tey said aloud in Na""vi as he came toward my brother. It took all of my power then to pretend I didn""t understand what he just said and restrain myself from jumping into action. Thankfully though the chief stopped him even as the some of the other warriors cheered him on, ""No, This is the first warrior dreamwalker we have seen. We need to learn more about him."" ""And you, what are you,"" Tsahik suddenly asked me as I turned my attention away from Tsu""tey. ""An entertainer. A singer, writer, but a diplomat mostly. I go between two nations and try to teach others, and learn from them also while doing so. I""m far from a scientist,"" I explained only partially as Tsahik looked me over and smiled, ""We could use a warrior and a diplomat. You know our language."" ""Bits, and pieces,"" I lied only partially as well. ""Good,"" and with that she turned to Neytiri, ""My daughter you will teach them our way..."" Neytiri scoffed annoyed as her mother continued, ""...to speak and walk as we do."" ""Why me? That""s not fair..."" but Tsahik wouldn""t hear of it as she held up her hand to silence Neytiri earning a frustrated growl from her daughter. ""It is decided. My daughter will teach you are ways. Learn well JakeSully and MiaSully. Then we will see if your insanity can be cured,"" Tsahik finished as we both gave nervous nods in understanding. Then Neytiri came over and took us by the hands as she led us away to go change. Jake""s P.O.V Later after I changed I was waiting for Neytiri to finish with Mia. The only thing she gave me was a loincloth almost like a thong. It started driving me crazy at first, but now that I was getting used to it, it wasn""t so bad. She had also given me an armband for my right arm, to help cover the wound from the earlier viperwolf attack. It was placed high near my pecks. I didn""t look so bad, and ever few minutes I would catch some of the woman Na""vi looking in my direction as they giggled and spoke in their language, discussing only god knows what. Suddenly my ears perked up at the sound of footsteps. Looking up I found Neytiri in all her gorgeousness walking out with an exotic beauty.",806976
267,"After some time of just eating in silence, Inu-yasha would tell her parts of his life. That his father was a phantom beast of the western lands, and that his older brother hated him for being a half breed. He would not speak of his mother, or her family. So Kikyo spoke of her family, of her parents, and sister. About Sonoa and her early years at the shrine. In time, as Kikyo patrolled the village boarders, Inu-yasha would go with her. They would slay demons that tried to take the Jewel together. As she got to see the gentleness behind his growls and snarls, Kikyo began to fall in love with Inu-yasha. The only thing that held her back was...and this made her ashamed of herself...was his demon blood. So she never spoke of her feelings to him. Never said how she felt. One day, near mid summer, she was on her way to meet inu-yasha for lunch, and Keade was nearby, when they saw smoke in the distance. ""Sister, what-?"" ""It could be bandits,"" Kikyo said. ""Get the priests, now! I must get my medicines."" ""But what about your friend?"" the child asked. ""He will understand!"" Kikyo said as she rushed in the shrine to get her medicines. When she and the priests arrived, they saw a family huddled outside a hut. They were coughing, and the children were crying. The woman saw the approaching priests and priestess, and ran to them. ""We were attacked by bandits!"" she cried. ""One is still inside! His companions fled when they set the fire!"" ""Let him rot!"" yelled the eldest boy. Kikyo got off her horse and covered her head with a scarf as she ran inside the hut, the others shouting for her to stop. As she burst through the door, she used her sleeve to cover her mouth, until she saw the man on the floor. He was unconscious, and obviously badly burned. She went to him, held her breath, and put one of his burned arms over her shoulder. Then, dodging flames and falling lumber she managed to drag him out of the house. The other monks surrounded her as she dropped the man on the ground. He was barely breathing, but he still lived. ""We must treat his wounds now, Lady Kikyo."" ""Is there any place we can take him?"" Kikyo asked the family. ""There is a cave, over in the clearing,"" the mother said as she clutched her children. ""But why save him? He would have killed us!"" ""I will not let a man die because of his poorly chosen way of life,"" Kikyo told her. She and the monks carried him to the cave, and went to and from a nearby stream with wet bandages to cool him down. Kikyo applied many salves and ointments to the bandit, and gave him herbs mixed with tea and broth. After many hours, he lay breathing normally again. As Kikyo sat above him, applying more bandages to his burned head and face, his eyes opened. She looked down into his dark eyes. She tired harder not to be sickened by the smell of burnt flesh and hair. As the eyes looked up at her, his burned lips cracked open, and he breathed in deed before he croaked out, ""Who...are...you?"" ""I am Kikyo the Priestess,"" she replied. ""You...saved me from...the flames..."" ""Yes."" she said, as she put the left over bandages away.",512464
56,"Randy eyed a half-eaten pepperoni pizza slice, which was currently home to enough green fuzzies that it made Randy want to throw up. Apparently mold grew quick around here. ""This makes the basement at our house look cleaner than a hospital floor,"" Randy said. ""More sterile, too."" Brad didn""t voice an opinion, but Randy shuffled quickly towards the exit. The move to England couldn""t come soon enough. ""So we""re really getting married?"" Randy asked Brad, as they strolled through the local park. ""Yep,"" Brad said. ""Otherwise you""ll be homeless when we get to Southburgh Cross."" ""Where?"" ""In England,"" Brad explained. ""That""s the city where the University of Chesterfield is located."" ""Ah,"" Randy said. ""Sounds very... British."" The trail forked into two halves; to the right the trail led into a small forest while the left led to the street. The sky was partially cloudy, but a sea wind began blowing in from the ocean, signaling rain. It was getting darker, and they hadn""t had dinner yet. ""Are you hungry?"" Brad asked. ""Depends. Are we going to that hot dog stand again?"" Brad laughed. ""No. There""s an Italian restaurant I want to take you to."" ""This is sounding vaguely romantic,"" Randy said. ""What""s the catch?"" Brad grabbed Randy""s arm, and stepped in front of him. ""What, I can be romantic every now and then, can""t I?"" ""Mmm. On occasion,"" Randy confirmed. Brad gently caressed the side of Randy""s face, pulling him in for a kiss. When Brad stepped back, he kept a hold of Randy""s hand, pulling them towards the restaurant. ""Osteria Dei Mascalzoni is having a two for one special, with your choice of one free dessert for two,"" Brad said. ""It""s a really nice place. Some of the guys down at the sports center recommended it."" Randy thought about it for a minute. ""Good enough for me,"" Randy said with a shrug. The idea of marriage didn""t fully hit Randy until they were at the Osteria Dei Mascalzoni restaurant, having just been seated at two-seat table near one of the floor to wall windows overlooking the street. Whatever the reason, Randy was going to be married. As in, life partners, joint bank accounts, couples therapy, and Mr. and Mr. Randy Taylor checkbooks. Even if they were getting married just for housing purposes over in England, marriage was still marriage. It wasn""t even fake marriage, there was going to be a totally bona-fide legal document stating they have pledged to spend the rest of their life together, barring future grounds for divorce. Although, getting married to Brad wasn""t so bad. Randy hadn""t actually had plans to date anyone other than Brad; he had almost taken it for granted that they would always be together. Now was their chance to prove it. Randy had hoped that it would be slightly more romantic. ""Randy."" The sun was setting, pinks and oranges lighting up the sky. Brad tapped Randy on his hand. ""Randy,"" Brad said again. ""Huh? Oh, sorry,"" Randy apologized. A waiter in a black tuxedo stopped by their table with two menus. ""Would you like something to drink?"" They ordered two drinks, and side glass of water for Randy.",583994
484,"If that makes any sense."" She smiled, her fake teeth making it feel strange. ""Yes, I am Madam Lulu."" She waved her hands in what she hoped was a mysterious manner. ""The spirits changed me, giving me visions, but leaving my appearance changed and my memory faulty."" ""Oh,"" all three of her were they employees, nodded in agreement. They didn""t question it further, introducing themselves instead and telling her that they were the circus"" freaks. Working in an academy had helped Olivia develop a particular disdain for that world. ""A freak show, but you""re not freaks."" All three of the people before looked down, clearly ashamed. Kevin spoke on behalf of them all once more. ""Of course we are. Freaks not fit for the normal world, our only work possible in this dreadful place."" Saddened by his pessimistic words, Olivia made what she thought was a kind decision. She announced, ""I""m closing down the freak show. No one will laugh and point at you again."" They wailed, ""No, please, we""ll be out on the streets. Not just freaks, but unemployed freaks."" Olivia looked at the three people before her. She thought it cruel to call them freaks and force them to do demeaning things to entertain others. But she didn""t want to fire them either, not when it made them this upset. Especially not with the starving lions roaming free. So reluctantly she agreed to keep the freak show running. They bowed with gratitude as they exited her tent. She hoped she had done the right thing. Olivia went back to discovering new information. She looked through the books, reorganizing them with the skills of a trained librarian, as she read some of the covers. She kept out the books she figured would be best to start with. She also noticed the phone in the cupboard, it was marked ""For Emergencies."" She found one small can of film amongst the books. She looked for a projector and once she set it up, she watched what appeared to be a masquerade ball. There were crowds of people she didn""t recognize, but her heart fluttered when she spotted one familiar face - Jacques Snicket. He looked a little younger but just as handsome as he""d always been. The chiseled jaw and the determined eyes. Though his eyes betrayed annoyance in the film. Her gaze followed his line of sight in the grainy footage. Olivia""s happy expression fell when she spotted another face she recognized, though she nearly didn""t recognize the man dancing with the pretty, dark-haired woman who looked to be about the same age as Jacques. Olaf looked bathed and groomed, and strangest of all, happy and noble. Jacques was watching the couple with a look of distaste on his face, as though he""d just swallowed a mouthful of salmon water. Olivia studied the woman dancing with Olaf closer. She actually looked like the woman who""d been Madam Lulu before her. VFD""s best field agent. But why was she dancing with a villain then? Jacques looked younger, perhaps this happened long ago, back when Olaf was good and noble rather than the rotten man she knew now. He certainly didn""t look like the man she knew in the footage.",1497577
1058,"How does it feel to be a cat!"" Rio shouted in between laughs. Yuta hissed. ""Yuta the cat! Yuta the cat! YUTA THE CAAAAAAT!"" Some people chanted. Veins appeared on Yuta-the-cat""s head. Maya looked at Yuta the cat. ""Oh well. I think we also need a cat in this potion, right?"" She asked Luna. Luna looked at the scroll. ""Yes."" Maya smirked. She got a rope from her pocket. ""Yuta!"" She called with her sweetest voice. Yuta the cat turned and was met by Maya""s rope. In a few seconds, Yuta was again tied. The laughing in the hall died out after seeing that the cute little cat was again captured. Our favorite characters began to panic again. ""This time I""ll let you know the price you""d pay for messing up with an Orihara."" Maya positioned the poor Yuta above the cauldron. She let out a diabolically evil laugh. ""I""ll count to three."" ""One..."" Yuta the cat began struggling. ""Two..."" Mito and the others were panicking as they ran towards the cauldron. ""Three..."" Maya let go of the rope. ""RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING!!!!"" An alarm clock signaled the start of a new day. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------To Be Continued... So what do you think? Please Review!!! I""m so sorry that this chapter is lame and very random. Yeah, it is full of silliness. Could you imagine how Yuta-the-cat looks like? Aw! He""s SOOO CUTE! (Hugs Yuta-the-cat) Oh yeah, this is still not the true revenge... (smirks) (1) I really love that scene! That is why I cannot allow that to be left out here in my fic. That scene is very necessary for the start of the Ayu/Kaji pairing. (2) Yeah, I""m a big fan of Yu-gi-oh. Yami is the dark side of a person. They thought Nina had a dark side because the real Nina wouldn""t do such things. Konichiwa! Thank you for all your reviews! Chapter 7 Day 2: We""re locked. It was a nice beautiful morning at the Orihara Mansion and our favorite characters were ready to have breakfast. 7 pairs of eyes looked at each other intently around the rectangular table. They looked at each other in anticipation- waiting for someone to break the eerie silence that ruled over them. ""My, my! It is only your 2nd day here but it seems something interesting has already happened,"" Mrs. Orihara remarked. Everyone""s eyes turned to Yuta who glared at Maya. Maya cocked her head, looking back at Yuta with hidden amusement. ""Well, we could at least have breakfast first,"" Mr. Orihara said as the servants went in to serve the food. They ate in silence. Suddenly, the door opened to reveal a servant- Yuzuriha. ""Excuse me for the sudden interruption but Mr. Kirishima Yuta,"" she glanced at him, ""you have a package."" She handed him a package wrapped in cloth. Yuta curiously took it. Mito, who was sitting beside Yuta, glanced at the package, ""From whom was it?"" Mito asked after seeing that there was no card or something of that sort. ""I don""t now, Miss Mito."" ""That""s strange. How could anyone know that you are here?"" Tsujiai mused. ""Open it now, Yuta,"" Nina said. Yuta nodded and opened the cloth.",560480
499,"He groaned and his eyelids began to flutter when Catwoman heard the roar of the Batmobile over the police sirens. She realized it wasn""t slowing and threw herself over Batman""s body as it burst through the entrance. The noise had aroused Batman enough that his eyes were open but tellingly dazed. Catwoman took advantage of the situation and used his brief moment of consciousness to instruct him that she needed him to stand. He assisted her in getting into his car but leaned on her heavily. She climbed in the passenger side, worried to leave him alone, and he didn""t even seem to notice (which worried her even more). As if on autopilot he closed the top of the Batmobile and pushed some buttons that Catwoman assumed would take him home. He then lapsed back to the world of dreamless sleep. Catwoman suddenly felt extremely uncomfortable as the car drove itself to an unknown location. Part of her automatically began trying to map where they were going, as the location of Batman""s Cave was an extremely profitable piece of knowledge. But the scenery was passing by too quickly and there weren""t any easily identified markers for her to use. Her uncomfortable feeling doubled when the car seemed to be driving into a solid stone wall, though to her credit she didn""t flinch as they passed through it. When the vehicle came to a stop and the latch opened again, Catwoman tentatively poked her head up, trying to anticipate any other surprises. Upon seeing the Batcave, her breath caught and she stood to take it in like a starry-eyed fangirl. It was better than she could""ve possibly imagined. ""Master Bruce?"" Catwoman turned quickly to see an equally stunned Alfred Pennyworth. For a moment she didn""t get it, ""Alfred?"" Her eyes widened suddenly and turned back to the unconscious costumed man, Batman, Bruce Wayne. ""Holy shit!"" Though her shock wasn""t even close to subsiding, seeing his injuries again reminded her of the man""s situation and she put everything else on hold. She instructed Alfred, ""Help me."" Alfred was instantly there and the two of them carried the man out, and Alfred guided them to the medical bay. Selina had removed her mask about an hour ago. It was all too much to take, finding out the identity of Batman (and discovering Bruce""s secret) and watching Alfred treat him. She was back out in the more open part of the Cave, specifically she was checking out Batman""s, or was it Bruce""s, gallery of villain artifacts. She saw the giant penny featured in one of Harvey""s favorite stories, a dinosaur she didn""t know the story behind, along with many other things both familiar and unfamiliar. She nearly laughed when she came to a glass case with one of her costumes though. It was the one of her few with a skirt; she""d wondered where it had gone. Furthermore, she wondered how in the hell he""d gotten his hands on it. ""Miss,"" Alfred paused wondering what the appropriate way to address this woman would be. Since he""d gotten her attention with Miss he decided he""d just keep it at that, ""He""s still resting, but you may join him now if you""d like."" Selina bit her lip.",1497577
890,"""Eirk!"" Celeste cried, ""Stop, you""re getting worked up for nothing. You""re not a killer!"" He grabbed her shoulders and roughly shook her. ""Do you still cling to your own eception?"" he hissed. ""You still refuse to believe who I am!"" ""Let go of me!"" she yelled at him. ""Erik you""re hurting me!"" ""Open your eyes!"" he commanded her, ""I am a murdere and a monster!"" She wrenched an arm free and slapped him hard. He let go of her and raised his hand to his cheek. They were both breathing hard. His panic had subsided. He dared to look at her. Tears of fear were in her eyes. ""Celeste..."" he whispered, reaching to wipe her cheek. She hiccupped, and he stopped his hand short. She turned around and reached for her table. She picked up a handkerchief and, sniffling, said, ""Look at you, you""re crying."" she started clearing away tears he hadn""t known he was shedding. He swallowed and croaked, ""So are you."" ""I""m fine,"" she said. When she had dried his face she laid her hands in her lap. ""Celeste... I""m so sorry,"" he said, looking at her shoulders. He could see a small bruise or two where his fingertips had been. Had he held her that hard? ""I-I didn""t mean-"" ""I""ve had worse,"" she said, forcing a smile. ""I have no right,"" he said. ""I swore... I swore many things to myself after I met you. I swore I wouldn""t make the same mistakes... I wouldn""t hurt you or anyone else... and..."" He looked in her eyes, he flet his throat close up. His chest felt like his heart was bleeding in it. He knew this feeling. Her own eyes, dark as emeralds in the light of the candles, looked at him with such concern and worry. He swallowed again, ""And... other things."" She looked at him with confusion. He looked down form her face and saw that somehow her hands had gotten a hold of his. He closed his eyes and composed himself, letting his thumbs gently stroke the backs f her hands. "" It is too late for our exercises tonight,"" he said, getting up, taking back his hands. ""Tomorrow we will go over Carmen again, as well as prepare for next week""s Riggoletto."" He strode to the door that separated them, and said, over his shoulder, ""Good night, Celeste."" Before he closed the door, he heard her say softly, "" Good night, Erik."" Authoress""s Note: Thanks, Kiribilus. I""ll try and incorporate more singing. The tough part for me is finding the right places for people to break into song. Anyway, I also wanted to point out to you, and everyone else, that Celeste doesn""t sing. That will be explained in Chapter Five. Brief reminder, anything sung is down alone, by itslef, and has ""a "", while anyhting thought has ""a ' And as to how Erik will redeem himself... Who knows? On with the show! Chapter Four: Friends and Foes That night was quickly forgotten. Everyday Celeste spent the majority of her time practicing for the next show, both at the theatre and the instant she returned to the hotel. The week passed, with the entire cast and hands of the Vittoria waiting earnestly (and Erik in dread) for the arrival of Seniora Gudicelli. In fact, the lady did not even show on the day she was expected.",512464
2743,"He told you to watch me, eh? You can watch me sleep, then."" He closed his eyes and refused to speak for the rest of the night. Esmeralda was secretly grateful. The next morning, she awoke to Jehan grunting. ""Gypsy! Wake up!"" She stretched her aching muscles. The hard chair had not been a pleasant place to fall asleep. ""What do you want?"" she asked through a yawn. ""I need a chamber pot right now."" She retrieved it from under the bed, but then the obvious struck her. ""Hurry up! I""m about to flood my drawers!"" Jehan pleaded. She stared at him. ""Please,"" he begged. Awkwardly, she yanked his underpants down without looking. His nightshirt hid all of his scandalous parts. No sooner had she positioned the pot, she heard the stream of urine escape forcefully. It was hard to say who was more embarrassed. ""Thank you,"" he breathed, ""I think Claude would have ripped my innards out if he""d had to clean me up once more."" She carefully removed the now brimming pot and rearranged his nightclothes again. ""What day is it?"" Jehan asked wearily. ""It""s the morning of the third day,"" Esmeralda explained, ""since your arrival."" She opened the shutters of the window. It wasn""t quite dawn, but the sky was already changing colors. ""I feel as though I""ve been through a war,"" Jehan grumbled, ""and shot full of holes. I would love nothing more than to get these bloody chains off."" ""I""ll see what I can do,"" Esmeralda responded before leaving the room. She passed by Claude""s cell and peered through a crack in the door. He was still sleeping soundly in his creamy white nightclothes. She smiled...white made him look positively angelic. He looked too sober, too serious in the black robes he usually wore. By the time she returned to Jehan""s room, Jehan was out cold. He was snoring loudly, which Esmeralda took to be a good sign. At least he was sleeping normally! She decided to go get a cup of tea while she waited for them both to wake up. Ginger tiptoed down the stairs looking like a little ghost in her pale nightdress. Very timidly, she pushed Claude""s door open with a creak. ""Father Claude? I had a terrible nightmare...may I sleep in here?"" There was just enough room in the narrow bed for her to squeeze in. Instinctively, one of Claude""s arms closed protectively around her. She smiled softly and closed her eyes. The sun rose higher, staining the world with its red light. Eventually, the red turned to gold and the world began to wake up. The shopkeepers opened their doors and all sorts of good smells wafted out. The people of Paris began to mill around in the streets and the sound of horses"" hooves clopped on the cobblestones. Claude stirred awake, wondering why his body felt so heavy. When he opened his eyes, there was something soft and black in the way. He was vaguely surprised to see that he had rolled over on his back and Ginger was laying with her head on his chest. Andrew was on his other side with one little arm flung over his stomach. He smiled warmly. ""Wake up, little ones."" They both yawned and stirred awake. ""What are you both doing here?"" he asked.",870118
601,"Looming over him like a tormenting spirit, the gold toothed Doctor held up a syringe full of red liquid of some kind. In terms of hue and even that bloody smell, the liquid was similar to the red stones. ""A philosopher""s stone,"" the Doctor squeaked, ""containing two million souls; half for your and half for your brother."" Brother? What brother? Fuhrer candidate number twelve knew better than to ask; curiosity was beaten out of him from an early age. Nothing though, no training or stamina could have prepared number Twelve for when the Doctor shoved the syringe into his gory eye socket and injected the liquid form of the philosopher""s stone. The effect was instantaneous. The philosopher""s stone penetrated the blood brain barrier and went right into Wrath""s grey matter. In an instant, the young man""s body was torn apart in an instant and instantly rebuilt again by the ravages of the stone. Fuhrer Candidate number twelve screamed and screamed until his vocal cords bled and then he screamed even louder. Isaac just smirked as if this were his version of Sunday night football while Cain Knightlord fluttered his eyelashes dreamily. As number Twelve transformed, an effect was happening on the alchemic array. Red, crackling energy was flowing down the thick cables and into the array. Powerful energy filled the alchemic runes and the eyeball in the center of it began to transform. It shook and then something burst out of it like an egg. A small, deformed limb punched through the pupil of the eye, like the wing of a radioactive deformed bird chick. Without warning, the whole eyeball burst open and the bastard child of aborted foetuses and pesticide infected reptiles flopped out and began to shriek almost as loudly as number Twelve was. As energy continued to flow down the cables; the deformed monstrosity at the center of the array began to grow. Bone grew faster than muscle and whole patches of skin seemed to rot and fall off. In a matter of moments, the mutant demon child was man sized but only man shaped in the most basic, crude way. Among many other deformities, its cranium had failed to grow and its oversized brain was exposed and pulsating. Suddenly, the light from the alchemic array changed from red to a deep amethyst color and the red stones began to melt into sticky liquid and flow into the body of the homunculus. Inside him, number Twelve could feel them, one millions souls inside him. These were the souls of the wrathful-child killers, war criminals, woman bashers and rapists, psychopaths and serial killers. He could feel all their collective anger inside of him. Yet, as the philosopher""s stone began to rewrite his brain chemistry and modify the brain structure to one similar to an advanced computer, Fuhrer Candidate number twelve began to feel different. He was feeling, angry-furious even; all the synonyms for angry in every language ever spoken could not describe how he felt. No, he wasn""t trapped with one million wrathful souls. The one million souls were trapped with him. And as soon as it had begun, the process was complete.",1220273
2060,"Her hair was a dark maroon, which could be mistaken for blood, and her skin was so pale that she looked translucent. In fact she was, because you could see right through her. Seeing how Matt wasn""t saying anything, I was guessing he couldn""t see her, but he did see my wide eyes however, as they stared at the opposite end of the bed. ""What""s wrong,"" Matt asked in worry. Closing my eyes and shaking my head I tried to rid the ghost girl from the room. When I opened my eyes again she was gone. ""Nothing, just a little tired,"" I answered forcing a smile toward him. ""I would think so. Like you said, you just had your head drilled into,"" Matt chuckled before leaning up and kissing my forehead. ""You should get some real sleep,"" Matt said as he began to pull away, but I pulled him back. ""What,"" he questioned with concerned eyes. ""Lay with me. Please,"" I begged as my face took on the puppy dog pout. Matt chuckled as he shook his head at me. Before another word could be said he pulled back the covers and then hopped into the bed with me. I was a little surprised he fit so well, but then again this was no normal hospital bed you would see in a low class hospital. This hospital was almost like sleeping in your own bed, well at least as normal as your own bed could be minus the remote control that could make it go up and down. With Matt lying next to me I was in dreamland before I could count to 3. Matt was right though about me not needing chemo. Apparently they had ""gotten it all out,' so there would be no need for it. They said they would still like to run tests on me in the near future just incase. They told me that there was a possibility that it could come back. That was not something I wanted to hear. Something else I didn""t want to hear was that Matt had another treatment today. So when we finally got to go home, not only was my body, mind, and spirit hurting, so was Matt""s. I guess Matt felt a little cheated that I, unlike him, didn""t need the treatments. The reason why I thought this was because the whole entire trip home he was a little grumpy. Okay, maybe that was an understatement because the boy was acting like a complete prick right now. The moment we stepped foot into the house he immediately took off to his room while I headed toward the living room. Normally I wouldn""t think anything of this, but the look on his face just didn""t seem right. ""Earth to Shay,"" Wendy called as she waved her hand in my face. ""Huh,"" came my reply. ""Okay, did those doctors mess up your hearing or something, or did you just tune out,"" Wendy smiled at me. ""Nah, I just tuned out,"" came my quiet reply. ""So, what""s bugging Matt,"" Wendy asked looking over at the door that led down to the basement. ""I don""t know. Maybe the stress of the chemo,"" I lied. ""Yeah, I hope so,"" Wendy frowned as she slowly turned her gaze back to me. ""I got you something missy,"" she smiled as she suddenly threw a heavy object in my lap. I looked down and smiled at the lump that now sat there. ""Did I ever mention how much I love you,"" I chuckled as I picked up the book.",806976
1551,"""I love this sport. I shall have it be that every time the sea freezes over, we""ll go ice skating."" ""Sounds wonderful Loki."" He pulled her roughly against his chest, breathlessly staring down into her eyes. ""If I were to tell you, you were the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. What would you say?"" ""I would say you are lying... Alvida was prettier than me."" Ava looked down, feeling less confident than she did before. She looked very similar to Alvida, if she wasn""t related to the woman, Loki never would have any interest in her. ""Look at me, Ava."" He grabbed her chin and pulled her to look up at him. ""I realize now that you aren""t her and perhaps the true fate was that we were never meant to be, that instead it was you, always you... The love of my life, the one of my dreams. I realized it was never her I needed, it was you."" She wrapped her arms around his neck and pressed her lips to his. ""I love you Loki."" Their lips continuously molded with one another, smacking and licking, biting and nipping. They were one of the same and forever would be in one another""s souls bound together. The magic around them slowly began to subside from Ava""s distraction. The ice from under them evaporated and their ice skates disappeared leaving them both barefoot. Loki""s skin began to turn a slow blue and the moment it reached his lips which were connected with her, she shot back. Her lips burning and turning a blood red, she looked at Loki with tear ringed eyes and confusion. Loki cursed, reaching forward for her she backed away. ""You... hurt... me."" She mumbled out as best she could with swollen red lips already filling with puss. His skin turning back to a shade of pale. ""I didn""t mean it. You must understand."" She ran off without listening to him, leaving to the infirmary so her wounded lips would survive another day. That evening at dinner, Loki grew worried, he barely ate and found that Ava had not returned from the infirmary. He felt terrible, disgusted in himself, he loved her and he had charred the very connection between their love... Her lips. He felt like a fool, to do such a thing, he felt like if only he could control his magic more fully around her, this wouldn""t have happened. He left the dining hall to the infirmary, completely and utterly abusing himself the entire way. When he had arrived, she was nowhere to be seen. He stopped a nearby nurse feeling panic fester in the depths of his heart. ""Where is my queen."" ""She is in the library, Prince Loki. Her lips were surprisingly healed with a simple anti-frost serum."" Loki felt panic no longer, instead he felt enraged. She dare stood him up at dinner, made him worry. He left for the library in a fumed walk, he wondered what would cause her to retreat from him without some ounce of curiosity. Did she really believe he would hurt her on purpose? He had to take his rationally, entering the library he was met by his queen. Who was sitting soundly upon a fur threaded couch with a blanket draped over her. She was reading a dark blue book with thick bindings and old manuscripts on each page.",6234395
1705,"The SOS Brigade is so small compared to the whole world..."" Haruhi says, and I rolled over for a moment so I was facing her, only to find that she""s moved herself right up to my face. The fact I can see she""s in a nightgown which accentuates her figure a bit, plus that she""s as close to my face as Koizumi can sometimes get, makes me blush more than ever. That""s right. I was blushing. ""Wouldn""t it be great if we could spread the SOS Brigade all over the world?"" she loudly says in my face, as she flashes a smile. In my blushing, I seriously couldn""t help but notice Haruhi""s looks. Not that I""ve ever looked at her like that or anything! I just can say that she is quite beautiful... ""Yeah, so you can boss around everyone else?"" I tell her, a hint of sarcasm in my voice, but Haruhi seems to ignore it, suddenly standing up from her sleeping bag, a familiar glint in her eyes. She""s pointing forward for no apparent reason, and her voice is booming throughout my room. ""Think about the bigger picture, Kyon! We could have a US Branch, and a European branch, and maybe a branch in Australia.....the possibilities are endless! There could be an SOS Brigade in every school all over the world!"" My response is turning around to ignore her, but she can""t seem to get the hint, and she keeps on speaking. ""...And so every single SOS Brigade will be dedicated to searching for unusual phenomenon like ours, and it""ll be mandatory for them to all have one mascot! Someone like Mikuru-chan is essential! Of course, I""ll be the International Brigade Commander of all of the SOS Brigades, since we did start it......Kyon! Are you even listening to me?"" she yells, before grabbing me by the back of my shirt and roughly pulling me off my bed. I land on the floor, and Haruhi is staring down at me like I""ve committed treason. Her eyes narrow as she speaks directly to me, and she""s poking at my chest. ""Listen, Kyon! You need to pay attention to me! Give some respect to your Brigade Chief!"" At this point, I""m extremely tired, and my limit is reaching its peak. Sure, being bossed around by Haruhi can be tolerable sometimes, but when it""s like this, well... ""You""re so stupid sometimes, Kyon! I wonder why I didn""t choose a more competent first member for the SOS Brigade..."" Haruhi said, and finally, something snaps in my head. ""Enough with the Brigade! You""re the one who forced me to join the stupid club in the first place! I didn""t even have a choice in the matter! Now please, Haruhi, can I just get some sleep?"" I nearly yelled back at her. In the instant I said those words; the expression on her face seemed to break. She started to look a little like Nagato, in that she wasn""t smiling, or frowning, or anything at all. She spoke softly to me as I looked up at her. ""Fine. I guess you can just get to sleep then."" Haruhi""s mood seemed to drop rapidly from that moment on, and as I crawled back into my bed, I could see she was turned away from me, probably staring at the wall. What I did wasn""t really so nice, but being tired as I was, I think I could have cared less at the moment.",967934
913,"she shouted back, standing and crossing to the window. She looked out to watch her students...her girls...still practicing in the garden. ""and I cannot keep it pure...I...I have..."" she said, her head bowed in shame, ""I have begun to lose my powers."" ""But...That""s impossible!"" Kohaku said, leaping up to cross to her. ""Unless..."" ""When Kikyo is ready,"" she said, ""I will resign, and leave this place. The strain has...become too much, brother."" she said, sitting again. ""I am tired, and worn far beyond my years can show. But Kikyo...She is stronger than I. She will be able to keep going. And Keade, though she is not as strong as her sister, is also strong enough to bear this burden. I am not."" ""Then perhaps she can-"" he began. ""NO!"" Sonoa said, straightening up. ""I will not give her the added burden of the Jewel!"" ""Let her come to our village, to test her strength, at least."" he begged. Sonoa sat and thought. She did not want Kikyo, the closest she would come to having a daughter, to have to bear the responsibility of protecting the horrid Shikon Jewel. But Her own efforts had drained Sonoa...She prayed for guidance...Then she got up, and went to the door. ""When do you leave,"" she asked her brother. ""At first light,"" he said. ""I will tell Kikyo,"" she said, ""That I am leaving for the village. I will return with you, brother."" she said. ""But when I die, and only after I die, ask her if she will bear the Jewel. If she refuses, then accept her wishes, and seek another."" ""It shall be done,"" Shako said, slapping his fist against his chest, ""Little Sister."" At first light the next day, Kikyo watched her mentor ride away with Shako, the leader of The Demon Slayers. Kikyo and her sister were still crying as they remembered their teacher""s confession about her past, and their farewell that night. Kikyo was now the official chief priestess of the Shrine. And Keade was her apprentice. Two days later, Kikyo felt how her new position had caged her. As she was walking in the gardens, a friend of hers, a young priest named Kahn, met her. She knew since she had first come to the shrine, for he was three years older than she, and an apprentice as well. Now, he walked with her, wishing to tell her something. ""You can tell me anything, Kahn,"" Kikyo said, ""What is it?"" ""Well..."" he said, blushing, ""I...I have decided to leave the Shrine, for I wish to marry."" ""That is wonderful,"" Kikyo said, giggling, ""Who is the lucky girl who won your heart? The milkmaid? A girl from the village?"" ""No,"" he said, blushing redder, ""The girl is you, Kikyo."" ""Me?"" she was stunned. ""But...I..."" ""Please, Kikyo, grant me this honor,"" he said, taking her hands in his. ""I have loved you for three years. I would have spoken last spring, but I was afraid you would not feel the same. Please, Kikyo, be my wife."" Kikyo bowed her head. She would have liked to accept, except that she did not love him as he loved her. And she had her duty. ""Forgive me, but I cannot, Kahn,"" she said quietly. ""I know of a girl, Tsuwisha, in the village. Her eyes light up whenever you are near her. She loves you.",512464
310,"Of course, there was still information that Himeko didn""t know about the situation. He would tell her that soon enough. ""It all comes down to you, Switch. You""re the best one with computers among us, so I""m afraid we aren""t much help to you."" Bossun admitted reluctantly. Switch just continued to look at the laptop screen for another few seconds, before turning his gaze to Bossun and typing quickly on his keyboard. [Despite how hard it is for me to admit it, I am starting to realize that the only path left for me leads directly to Yuuki-san. I never imagined that I would ever find myself saying such a thing.] Switch said, his voice filled with obvious discomfort. Bossun just put on big smile in hopes that he could make his friend feel just a little better. ""Just do whatever you have to do. No matter what, we""ll be behind you one hundred percent."" Himeko laughed under her breath. ""I guess the leader speaks some truth there. Go take care of your business. We""ll be waiting for you."" Switch stood up from his chair. With his computer slung over his shoulders, he looked back at his two fellow Sket Dan members with his blank stare. On the outside he seemed just as interesting as a block of flat stone. But on the inside, he was different. It might not look like it, but there was still a jumbled mix of emotions rolling around in Switch""s mind. Each one was practically screaming to be released. Only his powerful sense of reason stopped him from going truly insane. In the end, he was glad to know that his friends were supporting him no matter what. And even though he didn""t show this based on his expression, Bossun and Himeko somehow knew that he was grateful that they cared. [I will return. This business with Yuuki-san will be resolved once and for all. Try not to make a mess while I""m gone. And remember that the leader is fragile, Himeko!] Switch declared, before spinning around like a top and opening the door to the clubroom with astounding speed. He was already making his way down the hall by the time Himeko realized what he had just said. ""Hey! What""s with all those weird implications!"" she yelled as she waved Flagarance at Switch from just outside the clubroom door. ""Don""t go leaving after saying stuff like that, you coward!"" ""There he goes."" Bossun said with a cocky smile as he looked down the hallway right behind Himeko. ""I had a feeling he""d be like this. Switch has a way of telling us things without actually telling exactly what they are."" ""What do you mean? You guys passing secrets behind my back now?"" Himeko barked, but even her raging expressions were unable to wipe the confident smile off of Bossun""s face. ""Switch has got things under control. That""s been pretty obvious to me for awhile now."" Himeko grumbled before dropping down on the tatami mat. ""So you did figure something out the other night. Care to tell me why you lied about it?"" ""I can""t really say why. All I know is that we have to trust Switch about this. The virus on his computer isn""t a problem though. I""m pretty sure if he wanted to get rid of it, it would have been gone days ago.",967934
2581,"It was a nice beautiful morning at the Orihara Mansion and our favorite characters were ready to have breakfast. 7 pairs of eyes looked at each other intently around the rectangular table. They looked at each other in anticipation- waiting for someone to break the eerie silence that ruled over them. ""My, my! It is only your 2nd day here but it seems something interesting has already happened,"" Mrs. Orihara remarked. Everyone""s eyes turned to Yuta who glared at Maya. Maya cocked her head, looking back at Yuta with hidden amusement. ""Well, we could at least have breakfast first,"" Mr. Orihara said as the servants went in to serve the food. They ate in silence. Suddenly, the door opened to reveal a servant- Yuzuriha. ""Excuse me for the sudden interruption but Mr. Kirishima Yuta,"" she glanced at him, ""you have a package."" She handed him a package wrapped in cloth. Yuta curiously took it. Mito, who was sitting beside Yuta, glanced at the package, ""From whom was it?"" Mito asked after seeing that there was no card or something of that sort. ""I don""t now, Miss Mito."" ""That""s strange. How could anyone know that you are here?"" Tsujiai mused. ""Open it now, Yuta,"" Nina said. Yuta nodded and opened the cloth. Inside was a piece of cookie- chocolate chips flavor. It looked homemade. They looked curiously at it. ""What are we going to do with it?"" Kaji asked. ""Of course, he""s going to eat it!"" Rio said while pointing at Yuta. Yuta glared at him. ""What if this is poison?"" Yuta asked sarcastically. He glanced at Maya who gave no interest in the package. What if Maya sent it to poison him? She still hasn""t extracted her revenge on him. Yuta shrugged the idea. ""It could be that it is from your ADMIRERS, Yuta."" Mito emphasized the word ""admirers"". Yuta couldn""t help but blush. Hey, he was handsome so, naturally, he has admirers. Yuta got the cookie and stared at it. It could be poison or a delicious homemade cookie. He glanced at Maya who was still eating. It can""t be. She already made him suffer a lot even it was a dream. He shook his head and took a bite out of it. They waited for Yuta""s reaction in silence. He seemed perfectly normal until his eyes widened. ""What""s the matter!?"" Mito quickly asked. ""It""s..."" Yuta started. ""It""s?"" they repeated. ""It""s..."" ""It""s?"" ""It""s..."" ""It""s?"" ""It""s..."" ""It""s?"" ""It""s..."" ""Aw! Cut the suspense! What is it?!"" Mito banged her fist on the table out of frustration. ""It""s delicious!"" Yuta finished the cookie. They looked at him disbelievingly. ""Are you sure? No side effects?"" the prince asked. Yuta shook his head. ""This is one of the best cookies I have ever taste-"" he was cut of by an eerie laugh. They all turned to see the person who laughed. Maya. Yes, Maya. Yuta felt his throat dry. Maya was laughing, what does that mean? She didn""t react at the cookie before he took a bite out of it. Now, she is laughing like a maniac. Uh..oh... When Maya lets out an evil laugh, it could only mean trouble. ""You liked the cookie, Kirishima-kun?"" she asked using the sweetest voice she could muster.",560480
3614,"The soldiers prepared for the warm-up, as Eren got on his back while Mikasa held his knees and help spot him. The awkwardness was obvious between them, even the other soldiers were aware of it. ""Why would the corporal pair them up? Their awkward air is quite obvious..."" Armin muttered to himself. ""Come on Armin, let""s start the exercise."" Connie said, interrupting Armin""s thoughts. He nodded and went on. ""1... 2... 3... 4..."" Mikasa started her counting as Eren did his sit-ups. Her façade looked so blank, that Eren wondered if last night happened at all. ""Mikasa."" ""5... 6... 7... 8... 9..."" ""Mikasa."" ""10... 11... 12..."" ""Mikasa, listen to me just for one damn second!"" the brunet almost shouted, but not too loud for the corporal to hear. Mikasa on the other hand paused in her counting, her gaze stopping at Eren. ""What is it?"" she asked, mentally counting the sit-ups. ""You""re acting like nothing happened last night."" Eren said. ""Before I act like something happened, I need to know what your response is."" Mikasa rebutted, still keeping count. ""I like you too, goddammit! Can""t you even get that by the way I""m acting? I thought you were supposed to be the smart one between us!"" Eren replied brashly, as he sat up and stopped the exercise mid-way from Mikasa""s counting. His childhood friend, on the other hand, was so surprised that all the thoughts in her hand began to vanish, even the numbers that kept count on Eren""s sit-ups. Eren didn""t realize that he said that so loud for everyone in the training grounds to hear. Spontaneously, they all stopped from their exercise. Even the corporal was a bit surprised from what he just heard. Yet again, the brunet titan-shifter was caught up by his emotions. ""Way to go, Eren."" Armin muttered, a smile playing on his lips. Slowly, realization dawned upon Eren as he felt the stares of his classmates and the glare from his superior. He suddenly felt his face burn up. Ah shit. Good one, Eren. ""Who told you brats to stop? Everyone, get back to your exercises."" The corporal commanded, as the cadets continued their exercise, including Eren and Mikasa. We""ll have to talk later then. Eren thought as he continued with his sit-ups, not noticing that Mikasa wasn""t keeping count anymore. There wasn""t even any thoughts on her head now, just the shock from what Eren said. As the soldiers went inside the dining hall for breakfast, Squad Leader Hanji stood by the doorway of the hall""s entrance with her arms crossed, as if waiting for someone. Levi walked towards the door, eyeing the squad leader. He stopped on his tracks, exactly where she was standing. ""What?"" he asked. ""You totally did it on purpose."" Hanji replied. Levi rolled his eyes nonchalantly, as if Hanji was talking nonsense. ""I had a bet to win. The stakes are high."" Hanji chuckled. She knew that Levi really cared, bet or not.

""Oh, sure,"" she said, shutting her shoebox and rising to her feet in one lithe movement.

""They look perfect..."" We arrived at our room after talking about inconsequential things, and she thanked me for the escort before quickly heading to her desk to review her notes before class. She was such conscientious student. I sat down at my own desk, and glanced across at her. The guys who usually hung around me materialized, waiting for me to say something. Unlike usual, I voiced my actual thoughts, rather then censoring myself. ""Miyazawa-san sure is great,"" I said admiringly. ""She seems good and I can""t find any faults with her,"" I confessed. I had spent the entire night before thinking about her, wondering why I was becoming obsessed, and came to the conclusion that it was because she was everything I wanted. Perfection. The thing I sought most of all. ""Incredible that such a person exists,"" I mused, almost whispering. I had almost forgotten my audience. Two of them looked at me with disbelief and no small amount of disgust. ""HUH?"" They pouted, actually pouted. ""What are you saying, Arima?"" the first one asked. ""It""s like you""re describing about yourself,"" the second one echoed. ""Huh?"" I said. I had been thinking of Miyazawa, not myself. I did not see myself as perfect, merely as someone who worked hard to maintain a good image and good relations. They immediately started to tick off the qualities I worked so hard to present to the world. ""You topped the entrance exam!"" ""You""re great at sports!"" ""You""re handsome!"" ""Your personality is good!"" ""In all, you""re the most popular person in class!"" ""YOU""RE PERFECT, AREN""T YOU?"" they yelled, uncaring of the attention they were attracting. ""Eh?"" I said, because I was unable to think of anything saner to say. The last thing I wanted was for this uncomfortable spotlight to be shined on me. I didn""t want people to examine me too closely for fear they would see the emptiness and darkness within. One of them started yanking out his hair, and I fleetingly wondered if he was going to give himself bald patches. ""How can you be impressed by somebody else?"" he yelled, spinning around comedically The other looked at me like he thought I was nuts. ""Didn""t you know that everybody in this school knows about you, Arima?""",1112924
232,"Pam didn""t bother asking where Dawn was. As usual, he ate by himself and went upstairs. Despite the fact that other beings normally irritated the Hell out of him, he found himself missing Ramar, his constant companion in Hell. Ramar looked a lot like a dragon when he was in his natural form with black skin and glowing red eyes. He was about five or six times bigger than Blackheart and was a force to be reckoned with. As Blackheart was figuring out his powers in his earlier existence, Ramar would spar with him because he was one of the few that could take it without really seriously getting injured. Ramar also shared his sarcastic sense of humor and the two of them regularly played jokes on the demon guards for their own amusement. He missed having a friend. The Hidden had been an okay bunch, but they still did things that irritated him. How smart does one have to be to dodge the damn Ghost Rider""s chain, anyway? He watched Dawn leave down below. She must have felt him looking down at her because she looked up. Whether she actually saw him was unclear. The next day, everyone seemed to be in a crappy mood, especially him. It didn""t help that Dawn had kitchen duty and her radio was turned up. He gave the cup he was holding to the old man that was muttering something about ""young people these days"" and went to get the next order from her when he stopped for a second. He listened to her. She was singing along with the radio. She was actually quite good. He wondered what on earth she was doing working in a place like this when she should be onstage somewhere. Most human music sounded weird and irritating to him, but her voice wasn""t that way. Not again, he reminded himself, just get the damn coffee, take the damn money, and get the Hell out of here. But as hard as he was trying, he couldn""t block it out. It was all he could do just to pretend nothing was going on. There was something almost supernatural about Dawn""s singing. It made him wonder how such a sound could come from someone as plain-looking as she was. It pulled at his new soul, caressing it and enchanting it. Suddenly, he realized that she wasn""t human. No human sounded like that. There was only one thing that she could possibly be: Great, just perfect, he thought irritably, she""s a damned Siren. That""s all I need right now... Sirens were once a powerful species. Contrary to popular belief, they weren""t all females. There had once been males, too, and they""d all lived on an island in the middle of the ocean. He couldn""t remember how the rest of the myth went, but he knew that they had wings in their natural forms and their ethereal voices could bend the opposite gender to their will quite easily. He couldn""t remember exactly what had happened to them, as he hadn""t been around when it did, but he knew that they""d been forced to take on human forms and they never told their children what they were. Part of him wanted to yell at Dawn in frustration because she had no earthly idea what power she possessed.",870118
1485,"It""s frisson, the awareness of where he is and how he is and how much she wants to suck a hickie into the fine curve of his stubbly neck. She""s only human. At some point, they""re going to end up in bed together and what happens afterward will be typical of her relationships. That doesn""t mean she""s not going to put up a fight and pretend they""re ""just friends."" ""I""m working on the schedule for the next month,"" Graham says. ""Are you okay with working second shift?"" Schedules. She hasn""t held a job with schedules since she was twenty. Her acceptance of this post had been more of a function of her wanting to piss Regina off than for any desire for regular work and security. She hadn""t realized the details of being tied down to a regular job since she""s so used to freelancing and calling the shots herself. Second shift is the two to ten bracket. Henry""s school doesn""t get out until three. ""Day shift only,"" she tells him. ""I can""t work nights."" ""Oh,"" he says, and there""s a long, knowing pause. ""Any reason?"" She shrugs. She""s not going to admit anything she doesn""t have to. Graham may be cute, but she doesn""t know if she can trust him. ""You""re a deliberate mystery, Emma Swan."" He tilts his head in a fashion that draws attention to the column of his throat, and the wild impulse to climb him like a tree crosses her head before she ruthlessly suppresses her libido. ""I don""t know who you are."" ""I""m a hard worker who does day shifts,"" she replies, her lips curling slightly, keeping her posture pure and making an effort not to send him any flirtatious hints. ""We""ll see."" He pauses, before saying, ""I""ve already checked the sex offender registry. And I also checked on your criminal history."" While his tone may be playful, she realizes that he""s telling the truth. He did try to track her. She knows it""s hypocritical, but she really hates it when someone runs a background check on her. She does her best to keep off the radars, but there""s no way someone who is existing on the right side of the law can avoid having an electronic trail right to their doorstep. And her record isn""t entirely clean. Graham doesn""t deserve an explanation, so she fobs him off by stating, ""I work in a rough business. We get assholes trying to play the blame game all the time. Please note I was never convicted."" ""Assault and battery is no laughing matter,"" he replies. ""I""m not laughing."" He laughs, like he""s expecting her to join in. She can""t. Emma appreciates humor, but she doesn""t laugh much. She""s spent most of her life just surviving. Right now, surviving means keeping her hormones in check and not jumping Graham to find out what his skin taste like. There""s a difference between needs and desires, and learning that distinction is the reason she""s made it as far as she has. She may want Graham, but she needs to be here for Henry. ""Just days,"" she repeats for a magic third time. ""Just days,"" he echoes, acquiescing more gracefully than she deserves. ""Maybe I should see about scheduling so we both get an evening off together next month.""",1112924
282,"""When I was with that man..."" A splitting pain in his head stopped him from talking, but he was determined to get past this. If not for himself, for Tsuzuki, for the only man in this world he felt he could trust. Hisoka kept his hands covering his temples but wanted more than anything to Tsuzuki""s arms holding him gently; a physical act that told him, ""yeah, there""s still one person in this world that loves me - and he""s holding me right now."" Just like that, Hisoka found Tsuzuki""s arms tightly around his chest. The soft whispers to calm him down floated upon his ears with a familiar voice. ""Shh, Hisoka. Calm down first. Relax your body and give yourself to me. Remember what I told you?"" Hisoka nodded hesitantly, waiting for Tsuzuki to continue. ""Don""t fight your memories and don""t force yourself. Trust in me completely; with your body, mind and soul. Feel me, right here, right now. I will remain calm no matter what you say. I will remain calm, and so will you."" Those same silent tears were running down his cheeks again, but unlike before he wasn""t upset over a nightmare, acting like a frightened child. Hisoka hadn""t felt such love before, love directed towards him. That did frighten him, but it made him very happy at the same time. There was something being able to stare so deeply into the night sky. The more Hisoka calmed his breathing and let his focus slip into a gentle lull, more and more he felt as if the outside world was slipping itself into a black void leaving just two people behind. No one else, besides the stars and the moon; he didn""t see the windows or hear the sound of cars and people that just two floors below them. The bad neighborhood, the passionate voices from the walls and those old, unsightly factory buildings around them disappeared with everything else into the night. Taking a deep breath, and focusing on the sound of Tsuzuki""s breathing near his ear gave him courage to maybe, just maybe be able to accept what had happened to him. ""That man..."" Even the sheer mention of Muraki""s name by proxy had him wanting to fight the memories and scream out against the world. But that wasn""t right; he had to think only of that beautiful white moon and Tsuzuki""s warm breaths on his neck. ""Back in that... horrid mansion, I remember that Muraki had me tied to a wall like a crucifixion. Sharp witches"" hair covered every part of my body; even though I was dressed I felt the hair dig into my skin like knives. There was so much blood, my blood draining to the floor. He... did things, even though I was tied up he still did those things to my body and... and I-"" Hisoka""s felt his voice start to shake uncontrollably causing a fresh pain to develop in his body. Tsuzuki never said a word, but Hisoka felt him everywhere now. Everything felt warm, and when he thought of that the shaking panic stopped. The night became longer and longer still as he stared blankly at the moon. His mind was beginning to panic the more he remembered, so he let Tsuzuki show him the way to redemption.",583994
1432,"""Still thinking about it, Kuwabara-jiisan,"" Hikaru answered. ""I""m still not sure I want to become a pro."" ""You""re acting like you""d pass it without question,"" Kuwabara retorted, before letting out a cackling laugh. ""I beat Akira fairly regularly, don""t I?"" Akira would have snorted, if his mother hadn""t been there. ""One in every five matches, maybe,"" he corrected. ""I wouldn""t call that regularly."" ""That""s better than any of the young pros, though? When""s the last time you lost to a lower-dan?"" Akira lowered his eyes, not willing to seem boastful. ""My boy""s never lost to anyone under a five-dan rating since entering the pro league!"" His father answered for him instead, punctuating the statement with another laugh. ""So what? Mother still beats me on a daily basis, and she""s not a professional."" His father cast a sly look at Kouko. ""She""s a very special lady. One in a billion - but that""s no excuse for not seeking to advance in the professional world. Most of the best players in the world compete professionally."" ""But not all,"" Akira returned. ""What about SAI?"" As soon as he spoke, Akira knew he""d said the wrong thing. He was sitting in a room with two of the very few people who might have a better idea of who SAI was than anyone else, but his mother had never done anything to acknowledge her tie with SAI, and Hikaru had never acknowledge he even recognized the name. The silence weighed heavily in the room, and Akira wished there was a way to take back his words. His father didn""t seem inclined to help, instead looking at Kouko with narrowed eyes. But she merely lifted her chopsticks, daintily eating a mouthful of rice. ""You know about SAI?"" Hikaru said after a long moment. ""I didn""t know you were into NetGo."" ""I didn""t know you were,"" Akira replied pertly. ""And most of the younger pros follow NetGo avidly, especially since SAI started playing regularly."" None of the Kuwabara family could miss the way Hikaru shifted in his seat, squirming with discomfort. ""Oh,"" he said, ""I thought NetGo was too casual for you. I mean, the games don""t count for anything..."" ""All games count,"" Kouko said softly, her eyes catching Hikaru""s through their sheer intensity. ""Every Go player""s game is changed by those they challenge, and they take another step on the road to the Hand of God."" It was really weird to watch his mother stare at his best friend like that, Akira thought, feeling a bit uncomfortable himself. He was the one who knew the truth, about how the two regularly fought over the goban. While he wasn""t convinced Hikaru was SAI, he did believe his friend had, at least, studied under that master""s hand. ""Playing Go online is a good thing, but it doesn""t match the real experience,"" Hikaru said. ""I mean, I like to watch the games SAI plays with KOUYO, but I get the feeling the games would be much better if they sat across the goban from each other, in person. There""s..."" he paused, tilting his head to the side as he searched for the words, ""an intensity that is missing without that challenge. I""m sure SAI would love to play against KOUYO for real.""",1112924
1838,"""Well, if it isn""t tha"" police kitteh."" Seras groaned as she heard Paladin Anderson chuckle. Of all the people to run into on her way to freedom, this took the cake. ""Get out of the way, Anderson,"" she threatened; not lowering her gun. Anderson just laughed. ""Ye expect ta kill meh with tha"" little pea shooter, lass?"" Seras wasn""t in the mood for this. At any moment they might all be blown sky high. ""Just get out of my way, please."" As disgusting as Anderson was, he""d never particularly been unkind to her in comparison with some people. The worst he""d done was comment about how he""d like to fuck her when he thought that she couldn""t hear him; and the man was a priest somehow. This caused more laughter from the Scottish priest, who calmly stood even as more shockwaves caused the lights overhead to blink on and off. ""Come on lass,"" he crooned. ""Give a servant o"" the lord some head."" At this, he began to thrust his hips forward a little and began to tease her. ""Come an"" see Alex""s big salami."" He began to laugh rancorously even as an explosion went off behind him. His behaviour, while lewd and immature was also raising Seras""s suspicions. For a man who""d sold out the Vatican in service to a vampire he seemed remarkably cavalier about the fact that bombs were going off inside Alucard""s fortress. Seras could even begin to hear the sound of Alucard""s subjects being killed in the explosions. ""Are you mad?"" Seras screamed. ""We could both be killed."" ""Nae fear o"" tha"" lass,"" he reassured her. ""Ah know exactly where an"" when the bombs will fly."" Seras blinked owlishly at Anderson but knew better than to take her aim off of him. ""How would you know that?"" ""Because ah helped set them up,"" he said it like it was the most obvious answer in the world. Another explosion caused the lights to flicker, throwing his glasses into glare and causing his eyes to resemble soulless white orbs; his white teeth shone in the semi-darkness. ""Me and one other man are responsible fer this. Ah""m a fully-fledged triple agent."" Seras""s face frowned at the idea of a triple agent. ""Is there even such a thing as a triple agent?"" So he was working for the Vatican but was actually betraying them to work for Alucard and he was betraying Alucard to work for. . . who exactly? Anderson did a little mock bow. ""Ye""re looking at a triple agent, lass."" He straightened up and dusted off his cassock. ""Ah did most of the work but the second traitor was critical; ah couldnae done this without"" him."" Anderson leaned forwards, his glasses and teeth shone demonically. ""Now lass, since ah""ve got a full ten minutes afore the really big bomb goes off; how about ye give meh some head before ah pull off yours and stick it on a pike?"" ""Stay back,"" warned Seras. ""I don""t care that you betrayed Alucard but if you even touch me I won""t hesitate to spread you."" Anderson chuckled in a most unfriendly fashion. ""Tha""s alright; ah think ah""ll just settle fer killin"" ye afore ah leave."" Several seconds had gone by without an explosion. As Seras became aware of this fact, a squad of Alucard""s soldiers had appeared.",1220273

Maya ignored him. ""Okay, that was mean,"" he muttered.Sebastian sighed. He can""t stop Maya when she sets her mind into something. He turned to Yuta.

470,"""I almost didn""t turn away from you, even when the evidence was plain as the nose on my face. It was Malcador who showed me the truth about you."" ""Malcador?"" the Emperor said with surprise and amusement, ""Oh, he""s dead; nasty accident. It""s okay, he was only a glorified lawyer; one less lawyer in the galaxy won""t bring civilization to its knees."" One mighty hand grabbed Horus by the neck and hoisted him up, turning him so that he could see the final battle for Terra winding down; the fires and devastation beyond belief. The mere sight of such destruction and body count would have driven even the worst tyrants in human history mad with grief. Even now, the loyalist legions were busy torturing the last survivors of the rebels while the chaos infected were apparently gone without a trace. The screams rose up with the smoke, worse than all the suffering in the Dark Eldar city of Comorragh. The Emperor breathed in the fumes and smiled just as the sun was rising. ""You see Horus, in less than a day this will all be cleaned up and only the sanctioned truth will be known. Even the public records you love so much will be scrubbed."" If he was about to say anything else, the Emperor never go to it as Horus thrust a dagger into his father""s belly, hidden in the under layer of his destroyed armour. The Emperor hardly seemed to feel the dagger to the gut, humouring his son. With his other hand, Horus rammed a vortex grenade into the gaping abdominal wound before it rapidly sealed shut. Planting his foot on his father""s chest, Horus kicked the two of them apart. With his remaining strength, he pushed himself as far away as he could as the warp field detonated inside his father""s body. The effect was indescribable. Simultaneously the warp field ripped apart the atomic and subatomic particles of the emperor""s body while also erasing them from existence and sucking the existent/non-existent particles into the immaterium. Through ragged breaths, Horus watched the spot where his father had once been. The black hole like phenomenon should have destroyed him, but after everything he was not ready to do a victory lap yet. Horus raised himself up, still painfully aware of the battle dying down outside the palace house. With a heavy heart he surveyed the insanity below. From here he really had no idea where to go, the chances of really killing the Emperor were slim to none. A good point perhaps would be to deactivate the golden throne and leave the ruinous powers forever entombed in it. All his hopes however were dashed when a rip in the fabric of reality tore open like a vortex grenade in reverse. A light so bright it was unlike anything he""d ever seen blinded Horus. The light was so bright that it shone through his hand, through his eyelids and seared his retinas. A mortal man or even an astartes would have died from the light but Horus was cursed to see. Through the rip in the warp was a bright glow.",1220273
2037,"""No..."" ""Alright, so what you want to do is pull back as far as you can without actually breaking the string,"" Lara said, demonstrating with her bow. ""The faster the arrow goes, the more accuracy you""ll get. Don""t hold it for too long though, or else you""ll put too much strain on your arm."" Lara let go of the string and the arrow whizzed through the air, landing a little outside the red dot on the target. ""Nice one,"" Arthur commented. ""Thanks. Okay, you try it."" It was late afternoon, and surprisingly Arthur had made the lesson just as he had promised the day before. Lara had been a little skeptical- after all, he was a prince. Didn""t he have some princely duties or something? But then there he was, with his bow and his hair blowing in the wind like a god""s. He noticed her staring at him and cleared his throat; Lara blushed. She watched as he assumed the archery stance, with his legs slightly apart and the bow raised to shoulder level. He loaded, aimed- only to have the arrow bounce off the stone wall. ""Ah, well,"" Lara said, ""You get better as you practice. Go on, do it again."" ""You spend a lot of time with that Merlin boy,"" Arthur said casually as he restrung an arrow. ""Eh? Oh yeah. He""s kind of the only person I know in this city,"" Lara replied with a laugh. ""Are you guys... you know..."" he raised his eyebrows at her. ""What? Oh!"" Her eyes went wide as she realized what he was saying. ""No! No no no no, we""re just friends. Really, really good friends. Heh. Why do you ask?"" ""You talk about him a lot."" Arthur released the arrow and just missed the outer rims of the target. ""I... I do?"" He nodded as he loaded up again. Lara replayed their conversation in her head. With a pang of embarassment she realized she had been bringing Merlin up quite a lot. ""Once Merlin broke his bow""s string because he pulled too hard, so try not to put too much strain on it."" ""Merlin hardly manages to hit anything, so don""t worry if you don""t either."" God, it did sound like she was dating him. As she was contemplating this, Arthur""s third arrow managed to hit the outer rim of the target. ""Not bad!"" She beamed at her student. ""Really?"" Arthur said with a look of disapproval on his face. ""Yes! Merlin never-"" She caught herself just in time. Arthur laughed at her. ""Arthur!"" someone called. They both turned; it was a servant, hurrying up to them. ""My lady,"" the servant made a quick bow to Lara. Lara barely had time to register that she was supposed to bow back before the servant turned to Arthur. ""The King says it is time for you to get ready for the feast tonight."" ""Tell him I""ll be there in five minutes."" As the servant hurried off again Arthur rolled his eyes and made a swift motion across his neck. Lara giggled. ""Thanks for the help today,"" Arthur told her as he went to retrieve his arrows. ""You""re welcome. It was fun,"" Lara said. It was true- although Arthur could act like a spoiled brat sometimes, he could be very friendly and funny when he wanted to be. Which wasn""t very often. But it made Lara like him even more. As a friend. Right? Lara pondered this.",2855986
