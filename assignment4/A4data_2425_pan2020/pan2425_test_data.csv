110,"I mostly practice theatre dancing, given my job, but I do a beautiful tango... especially with a partner. *heart emoji* I rolled my eyes. [Aya]: A few styles, mainly belly dance and modern. Um... I am about to practice the... um... I am sorry, I do not know the Korean words, but it is called the Tribal Fusion style of belly dance. If you look up the dancer Irina Akulenko on YouTube, you can get an idea of it. I used to do a lot of tango and ballroom, but both usually require a partner and I... prefer dancing on my own. [ZEN]: Well, if you ever need a partner... *winking emoji* How did I know he was going to say that? I sighed. It had been a good few years since I could bring myself to stand up with a male partner. I""d managed it with my female dancing friends back in the States, but dancing with a male? It made me shiver and brought dark thoughts to my mind. But, wanting to keep the peace and not give too much away, I decided to play along. [Aya]: Hah, maybe one of these days casanova. [ZEN]: What""s that word mean? [Aya]: Tell me what jagiya means and I will. There was no answer, so I assumed he was busy and finished clearing out room, and started the music. It was calm and soothing, perfect for practicing isolation and slower choreography. I needed to keep my body in perfect shape if I wanted to succeed in classes. Even though my mind was in pieces... my body wouldn""t be. Ever again. Before I could begin, I caught his answer. [ZEN]: ... you really don""t know what jagiya means? I would""ve thought you""d have looked it up, then. Normally, yes. But my good translator was still packed somewhere, and I just hadn""t thought of noogling it yet. I typed as much in the chatroom. [ZEN]: Ahh, well I don""t know the equivalent word in English. I only know a few words of your language, myself. Mostly thing""s I""ve picked up from roles. It""s a term of endearment. Before I could butt in and ask exactly what that meant, he went on; [ZEN]: You mentioned music too; I know some piano myself, and obviously singing. What do you play? [Aya]: A few. Piano and violin, mainly. I used to sing, but not anymo- ghjks I froze. He didn""t need to know that. No one needed to know that, because if they knew, they""d ask why. Panicking a little, I smashed the back button on my phone... only for it to register as ""send"" in my haste. I stilled, sucking in a breath and squeezing my eyes shut. Heart palpating, fluttering in my chest as anxiety coursed through me. I opened one eye, slowly, halfway, when my phone vibrated with a reply. [ZEN]: You obviously didn""t mean to send that, so I won""t ask why. I would love to hear you play piano or violin though. *smiling emoji* I stared at my phone in shock. Anyone I met back home who didn""t already knew, always asked why. And here was this man, who I""d not actually met, acknowledging that but also letting it slide anyway. They always... pressed back home. I was known for my voice, for my playing, who when I started refusing to sing, and after everything happened, there were always questions.",748687
2482,"His face was lined and tired as he handed the mail over, and she knew without being told what the cause was. The local news stations had been roaring with special coverage about the death of Thomas Wayne and what it meant for Gotham. Barbara, like any true Gothamite, had been unable to avert her eyes from the coverage. She had heard Jim""s name and spent the entire evening glued to the screen, unable to think of anything except how Jim was being thrown off the deep end way too soon. ""How are you doing?"" she asked as she led him by the hand to the couch, setting the mail down as she took her place beside him. He shut his eyes. ""You heard?"" ""The whole city heard, Jim,"" she said gently. ""Thomas Wayne is - was - the richest man in Gotham."" ""That didn""t protect him from a bullet."" ""You""ll find who did it,"" Barbara reassured him. ""The only thing that can be done now is to bring the criminal to justice."" The slump in his shoulders worried her, so she pressed a kiss to his cheek before turning to the side table where the wine glasses were waiting. She had set out a bottle of a Mount Eden Chardonnay to chill in anticipation of Jim""s return. She personally preferred Cabernet, but didn""t want to inadvertently remind Jim of his night""s work by offering him red wine. Wordlessly she handed him the corkscrew and bottle, knowing he preferred to pour, and appreciating the remnant of chivalry that had been ingrained into him. He looked at the label with a frown on his face. ""I""m not sure drinking is a good idea right now. This case..."" ""Just a glass to help you sleep,"" she said coaxingly. ""You""re going to be very busy until you catch the perp, and you""ll work better if you can start fresh tomorrow."" Jim nodded, and she watched as his capable hands worked on decanting the bottle. She held the crystal wine glasses for them both as he poured a generous serving into each. Normally they would have toasted the day or celebrated spending time together, but that would have been inappropriate tonight. Instead, she settled in against his side, feeling the movement of his body as he breathed and sipped at his glass. ""There was a boy there."" ""Bruce Wayne. It""s a good thing he survived."" ""How did you..."" Jim started, flaring up before forcing himself to calm down. ""He""s a minor witness. The press isn""t supposed to use his name."" She downed the rest of her glass so she could return it safely to the side table. Reaching over, she rubbed his thigh comfortingly. ""Bruce Wayne isn""t just a minor. He""s now the Wayne family."" ""He""s a child who witnessed his parents murdered in front of his eyes. He was covered in their blood."" Barbara didn""t know how to explain what the Wayne family meant to Gotham, and how Bruce Wayne""s survival, even under horrible circumstances, was essential. There were few certainties in Gotham, but the Wayne family had always stood as the leaders of the city""s elite. The Waynes served as a moral conscience that so few people cared to give voice to. Jim wasn""t a Gothamite, despite moving to the city to be with Barbara.",1112924
1273,"""Go to sleep now, we have to go early tomorrow."" ""If you say so, Byakko-sama..."" ""Knock it off..."" ""Uhm...mm..."" Byakko looked at his older brother, who fell asleep faster than he could wake up. He had finally felt it best to retire for the night, bringing the book down and shutting off the candle that provided the only source of light within the room. A few minutes pass by... ""Byakko...now?"" A soft whisper. ""No...not yet..."" A reply came. ""Damn it...I can""t keep my hands to myself..."" ""Patience, brother. Or do you want to do this?"" ""Argh...you always have me by the neck!"" ""Enough talk and keep your mouth shut..."" ""Byakko-samaaaa..."" "".........now!"" Two globes of light exploded from their sheets as it started to move across the room erratically; before finding sight and closing in on the ceiling, where a dark figure came and fell before them. ""Ruwach...works everytime."" Tiger formed a pistol with his hands and blew at it haughtily before taking his position beside Byakko who had risen to examine the bodies that fell. ""Another assassin?"" Byakko rolled his eyes in sarcasm. ""I mean, c""mon, is that the only way they know how to introduce themselves without being knocked off by magic?"" ""Ehh?"" Tiger began cracking his knuckles, his nails now growing longer and sharper. ""I think we""re gonna have some time out of us tonight."" He began cracking the joints in his neck as well. From out of the blue, a dagger flew past the acolytes and dug itself neatly into the wooden post that stood across the room. Tiger had let a snarl out as Byakko assessed where the direction came from, it was from the window. A knight, obviously female for her armor was fitting to her curves, came flying in brandishing her Saber at both acolytes and taking her side with the slowly recovering assassin. This time, it was Byakko""s turn to do the same as Tiger, preparing himself for the battle that was to ensue. ""Lex Interna!"" Byakko thrust his palm forward, with the wind behind him following the chord of his movements. Both of the surprised bodies flew into the night air, along with the destroyed side of the room. Byakko thought it best to take the fight outside, as the room would cramp and ruin their style of fighting...to both of them. ""Y""know Byakko"" Tiger flew at his brother""s side, as Byakko appraised what he wanted to say."" That was gonna go out of our bill, wasn""t that?"" ""Better to destroy one side of a room than to destroy the entire building..."" Byakko grinned back, much to the entertainment of Tiger. Both had landed on their feet as the knight and assassin took their fighting stance. Byakko and Tiger did the same, taking their positions of fighting instinct. Both the assassin""s and the knight""s blades suddenly fevered with a pinkish tint. The knight began consulting with the assassin, but the assassin just ran a finger into her cain as if to shut her up, telling her to trust him on this. ""I don""t like this brother..."" Tiger spoke a low voice to Byakko. ""They had enchanted their weapons with poison..."" ""I know we are weak from it..."" Byakko spoke back.",583064
3644,"Elle said, looking at him with big, innocent eyes. ""What?"" ""He does."" With that, she kneed him in his balls with every ounce of strength she had left. ""Run, you guys!"" she said as Brand went down. They all complied, Elle limping out after them. ""Whoa, Elle!"" Chunk breathed in awe as they got their bikes. ""Where""d you learn to do that?"" She shrugged. ""I""m full of surprises. Now come on, before Brand comes out!"" ""You made me go up this big hill and said you""d give me a Twinkie,"" Chunk puffed ten minutes later. ""I""ll be late for dinner, and my mom""ll yell at me! She""s not gonna let me eat dinner and she""ll punish me!"" Mikey flew off his bike and ran to the edge of the hill. Mouth tried to stop in time but he ended up crashing into Elle, which made both of them topple over. She landed on the concrete on top of Mouth. ""Owww,"" she moaned. ""How many times am I going to fall today?"" ""I broke your fall,"" Mouth pointed out. ""You""re not the one with the sprained ankle."" ""I will be, because you just fell on me with your bony butt."" ""Again, ow."" ""Okay, sorry, goodbye,"" he made a shooing motion with his hands. ""Hey, you two! Quit screwing each other, we""ve got treasure to find!"" Mikey called over his shoulder. ""We""re not screwing each other, Mikey,"" Elle huffed. ""Besides, Mouth""s got nothing to screw with,"" she rolled off of him and onto the concrete. ""Hey!"" ""Oh, come on. And you wonder why you""ve never had a girlfriend."" Elle took his silence to mean he agreed with her. ""I can""t believe it! That""s it!"" Mikey suddenly exclaimed. Elle and Mouth joined them, each comparing the map and the sight in front of them. Mouth pulled out his comb and ran it through his hair again. ""Those three rocks out there, one, two three-"" Mikey pointed. Everyone started yelling in triumph and realization, and they were off again. ""This had better be it, Mikey,"" Chunk said, dropping his bike on the grass with a groan of relief. ""Shut up, Chunk,"" Mikey advised. ""Okay, so... what now?"" Mouth asked. ""Dunno..."" Mikey checked the map. ""There""s nothing listed here."" Elle sighed and put her hands in her pockets. Wait a second. She furrowed her brow as her hands closed around the doubloon. Puzzled, she pulled it out. She""d never really noticed the design on it before. There were three holes in it, all looking like... She did a double take. The holes mimicked the shapes of the rocks nearby. She held it up. Sure enough, the rocks fit in the holes perfectly. ""Guys! Check this out. The lighthouse, the rock, and the restaurant all fit in this doubloon perfectly!"" she told them excitedly. ""That must mean the rich stuff is by the restaurant!"" ""Wait a second,"" Mikey unfurled the map again. ""Mouth, translate..."" Mouth squinted to read the script. ""Diez veces diez-"" ""What""s that mean?"" ""Ten times ten,"" he explained, then continued. ""...stretching feet... to nearest northern point."" ""Which way is north?"" Mikey asked Data. Data fumbled with his compass as Mouth read the rest of the message. ""That is where.. you""ll find the treat."" ""The treat... the rich stuff!"" Elle exclaimed happily.",2855986
836,"He tried not to think about the assumption that they were husband and wife. He knew it would be best, a good cover that didn""t draw any undue attention to them. It was for the best, he knew. But when Olivia smiled at him in the elevator, the thought of calling her Mrs. Snicket made Jacques"" stomach twist further. They were about to share a private room together with one bed. Jacques swallowed. When the elevator doors closed he reminded himself of the mission. His dear friends"" children were counting on them. This wasn""t the time for romantic entanglements. Then when was? A voice in his head said, sounding suspiciously like Kit. You could die tomorrow, it said. This is a dangerous mission. Wouldn""t you rather die without regretting what you might have done with a woman you were beginning to love? Jacques swallowed again. Was he beginning to love her? He glanced at Olivia, who despite her nerves had a steely gaze trained ahead. She was determined and brave and beautiful. Yes, yes, he was beginning to love her. The elevator doors opened and they walked to their room - 13. He knew it was unlucky, most hotels didn""t even have room or floors labelled 13 due to silly superstitions, but he never cared for such nonsense. He unlocked the door and strode in. He set down his duffle bag by the window, preparing to set up a telescope and camera to watch Count Olaf""s and the banker""s cars. Olivia sat next to him on the bed, making him nervous though he did his best to hide it. ""Is there anything I can help you with?"" ""Yes,"" he nodded to the curtain. ""See if there""s an angle we can get where we can see both Poe and Olaf""s car at once."" She picked up his spyglass and moved to find the right angle. When she was bent over in front of him, she said, ""There. That""s the angle."" He ignored her ass in his face, moving to set up the telescope and camera at the angle she had indicated. When he looked through both lenses to check, he found the view to be perfect. Or as close as it could be. He stood up and told her, ""Nice work."" She smiled at him. Then she glanced at the bed, biting her lip as she put down the spyglass. He cleared his throat. ""I will take the first watch. You should lay down. Get some rest. We have an interminably long drive ahead of us tomorrow."" She looked down at her feet, playing with her hands. ""If we have the camera, do we really need a watch right away? We can find out and catch up if anyone leaves, right?"" He knew she was correct, but it felt neglectful. ""Yes, but we can""t sleep at the same time anyway. There""s only one bed."" ""Jacques,"" Olivia stepped closer to him. He tried not to stare at her lips, but they were right there, so inviting. It had been so long for him. As he worked up the courage to kiss her, she pulled him down to her, seizing his lips herself. It felt like heaven. Jacques"" hands moved to Olivia""s hips, bringing her in closer, deepening the kiss. He never wanted to stop kissing her. He brought her in tighter, wanting her so much, needing this more than he could remember needing anything.",1497577
1515,"Ed stood up straight, and blinked back at her, ""Huh?....Oh!....My Arm,"" he said, then he looked at it, and took his glove off, ""You like it?"" he asked. He then rolled up his sleeve, and showed her more of it. ""It""s called ""auto mail""...it""s a sort of mechanical prosthetic...I lost my right arm and left leg about ten years ago in..."" he stopped. He""d almost said how he really lost it. Transmuting base material to bring his and Al""s mother back. He lowered his arm, then said, ""In an accident..."" He looked at Winry. The look on her face said she knew he was lying, but he couldn""t tell anyone here he was from another world. He looked down, and said, ""Wanna see my leg? They were made by the best,"" he was reaching down, when Winry stood up. ""No,"" she said, reaching for the bowl. ""Its alright...Strangely enough I believe you when you say that."" She walked around the bed and went to the door. ""If you""re not too dizzy, you need to come on out...After Evening Mass, the Sisters will be going to bed..."" ""Oh..Okay,"" Ed said, getting up. Then he realized something. They""d been talking, and she""d sat beside him and she still didn""t know his name. He smirked, then said, ""I""m sorry, I just remembered. We weren""t introduced. I""m-"" ""Edward,"" Winry said. Ed""s eyes widened a bit, and he stood up straighter. ""How did you know my name?"" ""Your friend Noah told me."" Winry said. When she looked at him this time, her eyes smiled with her mouth. ""I""m sorry about before... When you come down, would you like to come to my house for dinner? Your brother and Noah are there right now."" Ed just stood there, feeling and looking a little like an idiot before he nodded, ""Oh, yeah! Yeah, that""d be great...Thank you."" Winry gave a soft giggle, ""Great. I""ll see you outside."" then she opened the door and vanished down the stairs. From the sound of it, she was almost skipping downstairs. Ed smiled to himself. She was the same...No doubt soon she would be wanting to study his arm and leg up close. Odd thing, though, he was actually looking forward to it. He let out a deep, good laugh as he stuck his hands in his pocket, then he went out the door, too. AN: If anyone feels bored, don""t worry. It""ll get juicy soon. The best is yet to come! Part Three Ed followed Winry from the church and up the road for a few minutes to a small house nearest the river. It wasn""t like the Rockbell""s house at all...Then again, Ed should have known it wouldn""t be exactly the same. Still, he smiled, seeing Winry acting so happy to be going home. Then Winry turned around, and looked back at him. ""I hope you like beef stew. I like to add extra vegetables,"" she said. ""Sounds good to me...As long as there""s not too much milk."" Ed said. ""Oh? Why? You don""t like milk?"" she asked him, walking backwards. ""Nope. Can""t stand it."" he replied. ""Oh, that explains it,"" she said. Ed frowned, then said louder, ""What""s that supposed to mean?"" ""Nothing,"" she said, with a giggle. She was making it hard for him to be angry. The Winry from Amestris never made it this hard.",512464
986,"You can have it. Let""s go, we gotta hurry."" Rei grabbed him roughly in his shoulder and dragged him into the backseat. Handing Yuuya the other helmet, both sped off into Downtown, Shibuya. ""Uh, Rei? What exactly are you gonna shop? And why bring me along?"" Yuuya curiously asked from the backseat. ""...You""ll see."" Rei kept his eye on the road. ""And hold on tighter, I can feel your hand slipping from my waist."" ""Ah? Isn""t this rather..."" Yuuya trailed, not able to say further on. ""Awkward?"" Rei completed, viewing Yuuya""s mild blush on his side mirror. ""Yuuya, what are you trying to get at?"" Because, somehow...I""m having the slightest idea now of what""s going on with you... ""Err...nothing."" Yuuya countered. ""Why would you think so?"" ""Let me guess...puberty hit you."" ""REI!"" Yuuya mouthed out loud, obviously embarrassed. ""I""ve hit that when I was twelve!"" ""When you were twelve, you were still the snot-nosed, crybaby I had to keep my eyes on or else he""d get himself stuck in the silliest situations."" Rei snickered. ""Oh...riiight. And I assume, you""ve hit yours much earlier? Because when I met you, you could have passed yourself as a working man...thinking of a lot of things not meant for your age..."" ""How do you know?"" Rei challenged him. ""You can""t say much about me, can you?"" ""What? That you""re an overly-miserable boy who""s got nothing to think when no one""s around but depression, anxiety and a lot of mood changes to boot? Man, you can beat someone who""s on menopause or something."" Yuuya sighed. ""All lies."" Rei replied softly, the scooter drowning his answer. Yuuya assumed he""d got nothing to say, so he kept his mouth shut as well. Both had finally reached Downtown, Shibuya. Rei dropped Yuuya in front of Hachi-ko and told him to wait there while he""d go find a suitable place to park the scooter. Yuuya sighed deeply, leaning on the statue of the dog. ""Hey, aren""t you Rei""s companion? Yuuya...right?"" A girl""s voice asked, Yuuya shifting his head left and right to find where the source came from. ""Yeah? And...who are you?"" He said, turning his head left and right again. ""Up here."" Yuuya glanced up, and after seeing a hefty lot of gymnastics and a soft landing, a familiar face came up to greet him. ""Hi!"" The girl grinned, waving her obviously over-manicured fingernails on Yuuya. ""Oh, hi Ran!"" Yuuya came up. ""Do you really have to sit on Hachi-ko?"" He asked, pointing back at the statue of the dog (which uncannily looked as if it was relieved!) ""Oh, that? AHAHAHAHA!"" Ran laughed, unperturbed. ""It""s a habit I""ve grown to."" She answered dismissively, waving her lacquered nails, Yuuya sweatdropping at her. ""By the way, where""s Rei?"" Ran looked sideways. ""He went to park the scooter somewhere. "" Yuuya laughed nervously, obviously not comfortable with the way Ran asked and scooted close to him. ""Ah, thought so. Thought it was impossible seeing you and Rei separate. You really are that close aren""t you?"" Ran scooted closer, leering at Yuuya. ""Ehh? We live in the same house! Of course, we""re that...eep!"" Yuuya clamped his mouth with his hands.",583064
881,"""Like I""m going to listen to you,"" Jamila said as she launched herself off the ground and kicked him into a nearby cabin where some soldiers were. They took one glance at him and then to Jamila and then stood up with guns in their hands pointed at him. But from behind them came a man wearing black that turned out of course to be Ardeth. He disarmed them and knocked them out all in once which was a little fun to watch. ""Oh great an idiot and an old wind bag put together what ever am I going to do,"" Jamila said sarcastically acting as if she was cringing in fear and then laughed at what she had just said. ""The girl is not the one who you need now hand over the child and I will not hurt you Jamila,"" Ardeth said. ""Hurt me I doubt you could even prick me,"" Jamila said but then added onto it by saying, ""Besides I love the fighting and the adrenalin so why should I surrender when I can fight."" Jamila looked in Alex""s direction and felt their eyes catch again and she felt like she was drowning his he blue eyes once more. She swore she knew him from somewhere but didn""t know where and she was beginning to fret over it now and that was not good at all. She was caught off guard by Ardeth who swept his leg around her feet making her trip. ""You should stop staring and defend yourself like you said you would,"" Ardeth said with a smirk. Jamila looked at him with as much hate and rage she could muster up and said, "" Oh I will believe me at that."" Jamila said kicking her foot around hitting Alex in the jaw and then scraped Ardeth""s stomach, which still hurt. Alex got up with a bleeding lip but nothing much other than that. Jamila noticed how Imhotep, Anck-Su-Namun, and the child were gone probably trying to get far away from the fight. She then noticed Ardeth retreat to the top of the train with Alex behind him. Jamila soon followed and found her hair whipping around her face and she quickly pulled out a tie and tied it to keep it out of her face. She looked around for those two but could not find them but what she did find was the ground as she was kicked from behind. She tried to get up but found another blow to the stomach as someone kicked her while she was down. She managed to roll over and see that Rick O""Connell was the cause of all the kicks. She sneered at him and then remembered a curse she had read in the book and mumbled it and soon the sand that was around them built up around him pushing him away. She got up and looked around and soon found the opened hatch and then she saw Ardeth come out as well as the Alex kid with no one. She then noticed the guards coming to the top of the train as well as they shot at them. Jamila let her small sand storm slow down enough for Rick to retreat. She looked up and found what looked like a huge balloon overhead. She also found that it was picking them up and that everyone was firing at them. ""Stop we need them for later so don""t shoot damn it,"" Jamila yelled in Egyptian over the roaring wind as the train moved fast. Every soldier stopped and held his gun down as they disappeared over a huge mound of sand.",806976

How does that saying go... Be careful what you wish for, because you might get it. May Jimmy keep his perfect image of me. May he keep his dream.

My heart started racing wildly, but I noticed very fast that this couldn""t be Yves. Unmistakably, the person was a man. It turned out to be Assistant Director Skinner. I talked to him for a while, but there wasn""t much we could talk about. I asked him about the agents Mulder and Scully, but he wouldn""t tell me anything. He just said that they were fine. The next person to arrive was Agent Reyes, and Agent Doggett came a few moments later. They were both very nice to me, although I had the slight suspicion that it took them a while to remember who I was. Once they had remembered, though, they asked me how I was and what I was doing. We talked a while, but then they had to leave. They were working on a new case, I reckoned, and their lunch break was over. They left together. I looked after them and noticed that they were walking very close side by side. Was it a coincidence... or was there something going on that I didn""t know? None of my business, of course. But this made me think of Yves, and my heart cringed.",240213

It cannot have been the Hellsings for they stay together and had to be in Sophia to kill Bartolome."" Alucard began to madly pace the room, a conqueror lost in the frenzy of the upcoming campaign. ""For this incident, I shall accuse the Vatican. Then, I shall covertly kill a few more vampires who advocated peace like the Romanovs. Their deaths I shall blame on Hellsing while my bounty hunters attack rebel leaders using the trademark weapons of the Hellsing Organization. By killing the Romanovs now, the assassins have robbed me of my chance to make justification for their deaths."" He rubbed his hands at the genius of it all. ""At this terrible onslaught by human assassins, rebel and loyalist alike will beg me for protection and the vampire world will be united once more. I shall repair the wounds created by Isaac Van Helsing all those years ago."" Seras saw a flaw with this plan. ""But my king, what about these mystery assassins? Won""t they strike again?"" Alucard laughed and wrung his hands. ""If my secret friends attack again, which I expect they will, I will use them as a boogieman to unite the splintered vampire kingdom."" He straightened up and calmed down. ""Seras,"" he ordered. She snapped to attention for he was brutal no matter what dissociative personality he inhabited. ""Yes my lord!"" ""Take all my paperwork and fill it out. Come back with an hour with it for me to approve. I need privacy now."" The moment she was gone, Alucard did the unthinkable and shut down all the security monitors on the wall. He wouldn""t need them for the next little bit. Pulling down a portrait of himself on the wall, he touched a hidden safe. The safe was enchanted so that if anyone except him touched the smooth metal they would be consumed by fire. The safe opened without a sound, the inside was darker than the depths of space; a gloomy miasma which sucked in all light and confused the eye. Alucard smirked and reached into the lightless void. It was so dark inside that the inside of the safe may have been infinite. After moments of searching in the empty expanse of the office safe, Alucard found what he was looking for. In his perfect white gloves, held as tenderly as an egg was a pink crystal ball the size of an overlarge grapefruit. Alucard gazed lovingly into the perfect glass orb. It gave off an internal pink light which illuminated Alucard""s gaunt features. This was Baba""s Grapefruit, one of seven crystal balls created by the ancient witch Baba Yaga. The grapefruit allowed its users the power to see the past, present or future. It gave its users near omniscience but for a price. The orb was addictive like heroine and it sucked the life slowly from its users just like any drug.",1220273
1739,"- T. S. Eliot Averill was more excited about my trip than I was, ""King""s Landing! Oh just think of all the things you""ll see, Synne! You""ll get to be in the court of the King. I hear he""s quite handsome!"" I rolled my eyes and giggled a bit. Sometimes the Dornish girl""s excitement was infectious, ""I doubt that, Avie. I am still a bastard, after all."" I closed and threw the latch on my trunk. It was the only thing I was bringing, stuffed with my meager belongings as well as all of Mother""s important ones, ""King""s Landing is a far ways from Dorne, you know. They don""t like us bastards much there."" ""Well, you""re not really a bastard though, are you?"" I""d told her the shortest version of the story a few days after Tyrion first arrived. How my parents were married for a very short time before his father had the marriage annulled. I sat down on the trunk to wait, ""That my parents were married when I was conceived doesn""t matter. They weren""t when I was born, and weren""t the whole of my life. I am still a bastard."" ""One born out of love and passion,"" Averill""s eyes couldn""t get more starry if she tried. She had such romantic notions of the nobility. I hoped she""d be able to keep those notions as long as possible; I was under no such illusions, ""Oh, you""ll have to write everyday."" ""We both can barely read our letters,"" I laughed, ""But I will. That""s probably the first thing my... father... will want me to know."" ""Ma""s gonna use the first Gold Dragon Lord Lannister gave us to to get Braddeck and I lessons in town,"" Averill said with a grin. Tyrion said he would give them one a year to tend to my mother""s grab and her shack, which Averill was in charge of, ""It won""t be like the tutor""s in King""s Landing of course."" And there was her devilish little smirking. I found myself at a sudden loss. Who knew when I would see this tiny little farm and it""s desert trees again? I grabbed Averill and hugged her fiercely, tears stinging my eyes, ""oh Avie... You""ll be good, right?"" ""You sound like Ma,"" She hugged me back just as tightly. Over her shoulder, a carriage and five men on horseback crested over a hill. I held her tighter, ""We""ll see each other again, Synne."" ""Of course, you""re like a sister to me,"" I pulled back as the carriage passed the farmhouse and stopped. The dirt path to my shack wouldn""t be good for it, ""You could probably plant that herb garden that you always wanted behind the shack, you know. I""ll send medicinal herb seeds from King""s Landing if I can."" ""Really?!"" And then her arms were thrown back around me and she squealed, ""Thank you, thank you!"" ""This is a touching sight."" I pulled away when Tyrion spoke. He was smiling, walking beside Bronn. I could see the others with the horses and the carriage by the farmhouse. I stood off the tiny trunk and Bronn moved around me to take it without a word, but smirking himself. I bowed to my... father, ""Thank you for your generosity with the Eddars, milord."" He crossed his arms but still smiled as he said, ""I thought we""d talked about that, Synne. Tyrion or Father.""",748687
43,"+Continue+ Summary: While Muraki had Hisoka captured under the light of red moon, what happened to Hisoka remains a mystery. His powers are suddenly on the fritz, memories are coming back to haunt him and Tsuzuki is the only one that can get close to Hisoka. After Tsuzuki rescued me from Muraki""s place, it took almost a three full weeks for me to recover. We haven""t heard from Muraki since then, but I fear the worst is still to come. Ever since I ""recovered"" nothing has been the same for me. Before, I just had the ability to sense others thoughts, but I could control it up to a point. Crowds were harder to control, but I usually made a point to stay away from large gatherings anyways. Now, though, I don""t see myself as the person I used to be. Not quite, at least. Even when I told Tsuzuki I loved him, we have become closer but my fear of people has increased to a point where I even had to take leave from certain assignments because I would end up fainting in the middle of a crowd. I think this is all happening because Muraki wants to control me. He can use me to get to Tsuzuki, we all know that. I don""t know what he did, but I don""t like it. I can sense every one""s feelings now, almost as if they were my own. I can""t seem to get used to it, every day is the same thing. After a time, I thought that maybe, just maybe it would be okay and yet... whatever it is that Muraki is planning, he sure has me like a puppet with strings. Other then live in the library almost full time, Tsuzuki takes me out so I can ""train"" my mind to control it. I have no idea what he was thinking of when he came up with that plan, but seeing as how he""s smarter then he looks I can""t just doubt him yet. Right now I""m on my way to the lake just outside our work building. Cherry trees in full bloom litter their petals along the ground. It""s pretty, but also somewhat eerie at the same time. That is the feeling I get, even when the scenery is so serene. ""Tsuzuki?"" Hisoka called out his partners name, but only silence answered his call. He had gotten to the meeting spot earlier then planned, so he couldn""t really complain about him being late until he was actually late. Hisoka sat down, leaning back leisurely on the grass. He had to lift his hand in surprise as he almost rested it on a smooth, flat rock. He smiled, ""Skipping stones, huh?"" With the flick of his wrist, and the instincts from (at least lately) lots of practice. The stone make seven skips across the lake before it sank with a small ""plunk"". ""I hope you weren""t waiting long, Hisoka."" Tsuzuki said as the sat down on the grass, pulling Hisoka into his arms. ""How have you been holding up? I""m sorry I""ve been so busy lately."" Hisoka huffed, ""Not as busy as the person whom you shoved ALL your paper work to."" ""Ehh? But.. but I have field work to do, and since you weren""t busy...."" Tsuzuki started to panic, his brain hastily trying to come up with some excuse but the look that Hisoka gave Tsuzuki wasn""t one of anger. He slapped his forehead, ""Ah, don""t do that to me. I thought you were seriously mad at me for a while.""",583994
1192,"A strange feeling, so foreign to me after so long, erupted in my stomach. I was so close, so close to giving in... his hands trailed up my bare arms and I shivered. They ghosted up my neck and everything felt warm, electric even. France shifted, and for a split second the cage his arms made around me was lifted. I bolted, ducking under his arm and flying off the bed. I winced when I twisted my wrist, crumpling to the floor off the side of the bed. But I had to get away; France wasn""t supposed to make me feel like this anymore. He wasn""t supposed to make me so vulnerable. He wasn""t supposed to make me love him so much. ""Sesel..."" France turned slowly but didn""t leave the bed, ""Mon amour, what-"" ""Non!"" I gripped the sides of my head, backing away from him until my head hit the far wall, ""Non, non, non! Arrêtez l""alarme!"" ""Victoria, ce-"" I heard the bed groan as France got off, but didn""t care. What right did he have to do this to me? The French Empire started the war. The French Empire took my islands, my home, my people away from me. He took everything, so why... Why couldn""t I hate him? ""NON!"" I had to get out. I had to. The fact I was in the middle of a French Empire encampment meant nothing. I couldn""t be in the same room as him. I wouldn""t let him make me feel like this... He moved, and I lunged for the door, fiddling with the rusted lock. I had to get out. Had to get out. Run away. Hide. Get away from France. Run, run, run away... ""Je t""aime!"" France yelled. My hand froze on the knob, just as I managed to get the lock open. Did he... did France just say he loves me? ""Sesel..."" Footsteps. Oh gods; I couldn""t move. I was frozen, his every word washing over me. His voice was low and frustrated and just a bit husky. I didn""t jump when his hand shot out from behind me, plucking mine from the door. France wrapped his strong arms around me, pulled me back against his chest, and leaned his head down to my shoulder, ""... Je t""aime, Victoria..."" France held me tightly in his arms, and I just stood there, too shocked to move a muscle. He nuzzled the crook of my neck and planted a light kiss there, causing a shock to flow through me. I gasped, broken from my shock. France chuckled sadly, ""Je t""aime... if you believe nothing else, mon amour... believe that. Don""t... don""t run away from me anymore."" He choked, and my eyes widened as he shook with sobs, ""Je ne pouvais pas le prendre... I. Love. You."" France punctuated every word, and I could feel them pierce my soul, ""Mon dieu... Seychelles, I need you."" ""F-Francis..."" The way he spoke - with such conviction, such emotion - left me breathless. France loved me. Francis Bonnefoy loved me. France""s arms tightened, and he trailed his lips from my ear, down my neck, and back up, ""S""il vous plait... s""il vous plaît, ne me quitte plus."" He was begging. Begging me not to go. Didn""t he know I couldn""t after he said that? Told me he loved me?",748687
1512,"She told me of her plans to rise and retake the world, how the era of the gods is coming to an end. She offered the chance of a second life. To live again, as myself, Achilles, hero of the Trojan War, but this time, I would be immortal. ""She promised me riches, castles, and power beyond anything! All I have to do is capture two small demigods and hand them over to her,"" He paused and glanced at Percy and Annabeth. ""Just that, and everything""s mine!"" Percy backed up as Achilles took a step forward, going straight through the bars. Once he had reached the other side, he seemed to solidify again. Realizing what was going on, Percy uncapped Riptide and held it up. He searched desperately in his mind for anything that could get them out of this. Unfortunately, he came up with nothing. Achilles took another step forward, forcing Percy to stand almost on top of Annabeth. Trying to buy some time Percy started speaking, trying to keep Achilles talking, because as long as he was talking he wasn""t killing them. Hopefully. (Percy really had no idea how well this guy could multitask, but hey, it was worth a shot.) ""But you""re a Greek hero, why would you turn against the gods?"" Achilles frowned, but it looked more like a grimace. ""Eternal life, boy! That""s what Gaea offered me! Do you have any idea what that means? The gods, bah! No matter how many men I killed, no matter how good of a fighter I was, they""d never let me become a god. No, that was a right they reserved for their precious children! The gods,"" he said again. ""What did they ever do for me?"" Annabeth looked up. ""Well Athena helped you win the fight against Hector,"" she pointed out rationally. ""I could have easily won that fight on my own, but the goddess of wisdom,"" he said wisdom sarcastically. ""Didn""t trust me. I had no godly blood."" His face was contorted, as if it couldn""t contain his rage. After a second, he shrugged and a cruel smile reappeared. ""It""s of no matter, for soon I shall be elevated beyond Athena or any of the pathetic Olympians! Now, to uphold my half of the bargain."" Achilles stepped forward again. Now, only a bout a foot separated him and Percy. Well, that appeared to be the end of the conversation. Still, Percy had bought them a couple of seconds. Now just a couple more to give them time to think of a plan. Even though he was horrible with Greek myths, Percy remembered that Achilles was extremely proud (that, Percy could tell just from their little chat) and would never back down from a fight. It probably wasn""t the best idea, Achilles was the greatest warrior who ever lived, and pretty much invincible. On the other hand though, Percy knew his weakness. If he could just get to it... And besides, Achilles didn""t want to kill them. Worse case scenario, they""d just wind up in the same situation. ""I challenge you to a dual,"" Percy said loudly. ""Percy!"" Annabeth cried indignantly, clearly thinking he had lost his mind.",2943978
855,"""I wanted to talk to you about that,"" she admitted uneasily. He searched her face for answers. ""You""re afraid I""ll lose my position,"" he guessed finally. ""Yes...and I can""t ask you to give it up,"" she sighed, ""I could never ask that of you. But...what will we do? We can never marry...and I cannot ask you to live a lie. But you have needs and..."" She was cut off by a smile. ""Is that all you""re worried about? That I""m not allowed to love you physically?"" He ran a gentle hand over her cheek and she leaned into his touch. ""As nice as I""m sure that would be,"" he said, leaning in closer, ""I could do without if I had to. As long as you""re around, making the stained glass and the flowers dull and dim by comparison, I""ll be content with whatever I have...your beautiful smile, the way the sunlight dances in your hair, the sound of your voice when you laugh...Don""t you see? Some people never get to where we are."" ""I feel selfish,"" Esmeralda muttered. ""Why?"" he asked, serious for a moment. ""Because...I want more."" He closed his eyes and leaned into her kiss. Heat rose in his middle, spreading like a raging inferno through his body. These robes were much thinner than the others he usually wore and his senses were unusually heightened to her touch. Feather light, she lit fires under his skin wherever her hands went. ""Esmeralda,"" he choked out as he rapidly lost the ability to put a coherent thought together. Her hands slid down his back and he shuddered pleasantly. She grinned, seeing his green-blue eyes turn dark like stormy seas. Her hands brushed against his shoulders, then his chest. His heart was pounding and it leapt when her palm rested just an inch or two above it on the surface. Her other hand trailed down to his narrow waist. Claude felt as though he would jump clean out of his skin any moment. Thankfully, the folds of the robes hid his evidence. All of his muscles had grown taut in an effort to keep still. I must not, he pleaded with himself, Oh, God in Heaven, Mary, Jesus...please help me...and her... Seeing the Herculean effort he was giving to not deflower her, her guilt grew. ""I have another confession,"" she admitted, ""I am not a virgin."" He stared at her for a moment, then tried to shrug nonchalantly. ""That doesn""t bother you?"" she asked. Claude winced. ""Well...a little,"" he admitted, ""but not for the reasons that it should..."" She waited for an explanation. ""Most would say because intercourse,"" Claude said awkwardly, ""before marriage is sinful...but how can you touch me without first comparing it to another man? I cannot ask you to forget him or any others you may have...touched."" In a bittersweet way, she understood. It was sweet...he wanted to be her first... In theory, of course. She buried her face in his shoulder, inhaling his scent. He crushed her against him, the tightness in his arms saying he couldn""t let her go if he wanted to. ""AHEM!"" Claude froze and released Esmeralda. Over her shoulder, he saw the last person in the world he wanted to see (besides Phoebus and Joseph, of course). ""Claude Frollo, what are you doing?""",870118
1016,"Jenny came up a little later to refill her drink, she started immediately needling Mira, ""Well, how is Fiore""s second prettiest model?"" ""I was just about to ask you that, Jenny."" Mira responded with a smile. She nodded to the empty glass in the frowning model""s hand. ""Can I refresh your drink?"" ""Yeah,"" Jenny handed Mira the glass. Mira began assembling a new drink for her rival. Jenny turned to face the table she""d been sitting at. ""You know, sometimes I miss having Laxus in our guild."" Mira""s hands stopped scooping ice for a moment before she forced herself to keep going. ""I always wondered, how did Laxus end up in your guild anyway?"" Mira hoped her voice didn""t betray her interest. Jenny didn""t act any differently, answering, ""Master wanted a good-looking bad boy in the guild. With his scar, tattoo and reputation, Laxus fit the description perfectly, so we recruited him."" Mira set down the finished drink by Jenny""s elbow, ""It didn""t have to do with the fact he was a powerful S Class Mage?"" ""That didn""t hurt, but no, it was the whole bad boy thing."" She looked over at the lightening dragon slayer. ""You know, I never did get a chance to sleep with him while he was in our guild. Bet he fucks like a stallion."" The smile didn""t leave Mira""s face, but her nails dug into her palms. ""I wouldn""t know."" Jenny grinned, and glanced back at Mira, ""Well, I""ll find out tonight and let you know."" As Jenny walked back to the table, Mira said through clenched teeth, ""Good luck with that."" Laxus wouldn""t sleep with her. Yes, Jenny was beautiful. And yes, they weren""t in any sort of official monogamous relationship, but still, he wouldn""t do that. Right? Right? Mira tried to put it out of her mind, but her eyes kept drifting to where Jenny sat next to Laxus. She laughed too loudly at his jokes and put her hands on his arms, eventually leaving them there, causally wrapped around his bicep. Laxus didn""t seem too interested, which may have comforted Mira if not for the fact that Laxus never looked interested in anyone. Even around her, he always acted cool. It bothered her all night, despite her best efforts. But she managed to keep it together. Until out of the corner of her eye, Mira saw Jenny moving closer to Laxus. She put a hand on his chest and whispered in his ear. Mira slammed a hand down on the bar and yelled, ""Jenny, get your hands off of my man!"" The guild went silent as everyone turned to where the Blue Pegasus mages were sitting to see what man Mira was referring to. Jenny smirked at Mira, leaning into Laxus further, who looked as surprised as everyone else at Mira""s outburst. Freed and Makarov reacted at the same time, ""What?!"" Freed turned to Laxus, ""Why didn""t you tell me? How did I not know?"" This triggered Evergreen and Bickslow to wonder the same thing. What kind of faithful bodyguards didn""t realize their fearless leader was dating someone? Makarov, on the other hand, yelled at Mira, ""Why would you pick him? You could do so much better, Mira."" Mira""s eyes hadn""t left Laxus"" though.",1497577
788,"Bronn shrugged, ""Ain""t no one gonna stop you. Careful though, King Jon""s pup mostly keeps to there when it ain""t with ""im."" ""His... pup?"" I blinked as we started to ascend the tower. King Jon had a son? This was the first I""d heard of it, I wonder why Jon didn""t mention- ""Big as all hell direwolf, terrifying white beast with eyes as red as blood,"" Bronn said, ""Best keep your distance from it. Calm and fucking quiet for a creature it""s size, but has one hell of a bite from what I""ve seen."" I held Florys a bit tighter and scratched behind her ear. The fox was definitely going to stay locked up in my room when not beside me. A giant wolf, in the Red Keep? Part of me really wanted to see the beast; the other was apprehensive. A short ways up the tower we came to a large antechamber of sorts. I assumed it was the receiving and entertaining chamber for the Hand. A dozen servants milled about, and a couple guards. Upon seeing me, all stopped what they were doing and bowed. I darted half behind Bronn, who raised an eyebrow. ""Stop hiding, girl. You may be a bastard, but these here are Lannister servants. They wouldn""t want to cross Tyrion by givin"" you no grief,"" He spoke a little louder than needed, casting a look over the lot. An elderly lady stepped forward. She looked... kind, if a bit large and forceful. She reminded me of Maenys, ""You must be milord""s daughter, Synne Sand."" ""Y-yes,"" I gulped and stepped out from behind Bronn, ""Th-that""s me."" She motioned for one of the female servants, a tall but somehow still mousy fiery-headed girl that looks just as nervous as I felt, ""Name""s Nan Groundswell. This here is my granddaughter, Lisette. I""m head servant in the Tower, and she""ll be your lady in waiting."" ""Hello, Lisette,"" I made a little wave, hoping to make us both feel better. Bronn just laughed, and my arm fell. Nan looked Bronn, ""I""m sure you have duties, ser. We""ll take the girl from here; Uric and Bolston already delivered her trunks."" Bronn turned to me, gave me a once over, and clapped a hand on my shoulder, ""Yer in good hands, Synne."" ""Y-you""re leaving?"" I didn""t want him to go and leave me alone with strangers. He was the last somewhat familiar thing here, now that my father had been whisked away. ""Don""t gimme that look, girl,"" He huffed, ""I live in the Tower too; Tyrion""s bodyguard and all. But I""ve got a lotta duties besides. Like I said, yer in good hands here."" I sighed and stepped away from the man, ""... alright."" Bronn left and Nan and Lisette whisked me away further up the Tower. They told me that my Father was housed at the very top, with many more rooms for anything from entertaining - like the large room we""d left - to rooms for guests, members of the Lannister household, even a very small library and study and a school room for the Hand""s children to learn in. I wondered if I would end up there. Then they brought me to a colossal bedroom. It was at least five times the size of mother""s whole shack, maybe even more.",748687
766,"Although, I""m pretty sure that all the warriors would fear you."" Twilight said. ""If they have, they""ll start with you."" Digger said. ""You should know."" Digger looked at Travis and said, ""Seemingly, I think your first battle will be a breeze."" ""How so?"" ""Same thing for me. We did this before we were crowned the Guardians of Ga""hoole and there""s no doubt you can be one too."" ""Really?"" Travis asked, excitedly. ""It depends."" ""Well, okay."" Ezylryb looked at Travis and said, ""You are ready."" ""Am I, really?"" ""Yes. You are."" All of the Guardians are ready to fly to St. Aggie""s to start another war and they""re ready to break out another battle. Boron lead them with Barran and they all flew out of Ga""hoole and when the time came, Soren, Travis, Gylfie, Otulissa, Digger, Twilight and Ezylryb flew behind them as they followed them to St. Aggie""s. Travis became extremely excited, but started to feel nervous and said, ""I hope I know what I""m doing..."" ""You will. You""re ready."" Soren said. ""I""m looking forward to be the new Guardian."" ""I strongly believe you will."" Will Travis"" training pay off? We""ll see! What you all have been waiting for! Chapter 11: Attack! As soon as the Guardians got to St. Aggie""s, they were prepping for something on how they""ll attack. Soon, Soren, Gylfie, Twilight, Digger, Otulissa, Ezylryb and Travis all went to the top of the mountain, hoping to have a plan in the works. TRavis panted heavily and asked, ""How do we want to fight them?"" ""Some of the tytos might show up and see you there and once he does, attack him in any form."" Ezylryb said. ""Won""t that be dangerous?"" asked Travis. ""Yes. Just remember your training."" ""And do not worry. We will catch them off-guard and they won""t stand a chance against us."" Otulissa spoke out. ""And...what about Kludd?"" ""What about him?"" ""You know if he sees me with you, he""ll literally devour me in shreds."" ""Well, he""ll have to get through us first."" Digger said. ""Oh, sure. And then what-dig a hole?"" asked Twilight. ""Hey, just because I dig holes doesn""t mean you have to give stupid comments about it."" ""And how can Kludd take down someone like you?"" ""He doesn""t know what I got."" ""We""ve battled St. Aggie""s before and there""s no doubt we can do it again. All we have to do is come up with something."" Gylfie said. ""And how are we gonna do that?"" asked Travis. Soren became silent for a while and he told them, ""We lure him back to our side."" ""Are you crazy? He will literally kill you."" ""I know my brother. He needs me. I have to save him."" ""Aren""t we supposed to fight him and then bring him to his death?"" ""We don""t have to bring him to his death anymore. At least, I don""t. He""s my brother. I have to save him from Nyra""s clutch."" ""You mean talons?"" ""Same thing."" ""I just hope you know what you""re doing."" All of a sudden, one tyto seeks Travis standing with the Guardians and decides to wait until he""s alone so he can defeat him. Boron flies towards them and calls out for Ezylryb and Otulissa. Both of them looked at Travis and wished him good luck and flies off with him.",1276465
3155,"""However,"" she continued, not finished just yet even as she listened to labored breathing of the survivors, ""Let it be known that all those who intend on joining this club will all be expected to go through Tennis Tartarus. No exceptions."" Omiko narrowed her eyes. She had to make sure this last part particularly sunk in. ""And one more thing. If I ever hear anyone of you say anything about my teeth, then I""ll let loose a 90 Thousand Cannonball Serve before on you before you can even draw your last breath."" A flash of her teeth, and that was all Omiko needed to get her point across. The No-Stars nodded in understanding before they finally got around to tending to their wounds. ""Looking good, Hakodate."" none other than Sanageyama said as he approached Omiko from afar, hands in his jacket pockets and a relatively carefree look on his face. Having caught her completely by surprise, the twin-tailed blonde found herself at a loss for words as the Elite Four member approached. She managed to snap out a few words before he got too close though. ""Get out of my sight."" she practically barked to the survivor No-Stars, and they easily obliged. But when Sanageyama was finally within earshot, her expression changed to a pleasant smile as she waved towards them. ""See you all tomorrow! Great work! What a great first day!"" But as expected, Sanageyama just laughed as he quickly saw through her ruse. Putting a hand on her shoulder, he shocked her again with nothing more than his touch, though she was quick to pass it off the sensation as she listened to him speak. ""You can cut the act, Hakodate. I""m already impressed enough."" he told her, and Omiko almost had to turn away to hide the redness on her face, before replying with as much confidence as she could muster. ""I...I aim to please, Sanageyama-sempai. And I promise you that this is only one step in my eventual goal of winning a One-Star Uniform."" she reassured him, to which Sanageyama just laughed. ""Of course. I have to tell you, Hakodate: Satsuki-sama herself was personally impressed with your performance today. That""s quite the feat, to impress her. You should be proud of yourself."" he told her, and in response, Omiko could only get down on one knee as she felt suddenly humbled by everything she had just been told. She nearly lost her breath at the very thought that a goddess like Satsuki was impressed by her measly accomplishments. ""With all respect, sempai, I owe it to your encouragement."" Omiko admitted, to which Sanageyama replied with a friendly laugh. ""I appreciate the sentiment, but you should give yourself a little more credit, Hakodate. I know potential when I see it."" Omiko nodded as she stood up, taking a brief moment to admire the Elite Four member before her. In fact, she was so lost in his golden smile, that she practically had to shake herself out of a daze. But Sanageyama himself seemed not to notice it, or chose not to care, putting a friendly hand on the girl""s shoulder again. ""Keep this up, and you""ll be way past Fukoroda before he even knows what hit him.",967934

She smiled and leaned against his shoulder for several minutes in companionable silence, leaving him to his thoughts. Keeping him company was all she could do at the moment. Eventually, her eye returned to the mail he had brought in with him. For lack of anything better to do, she picked it up to sort. Despite tragedy, life went on. Barbara flipped through, separating out the items addressed to him from her own. Most of the mail was addressed to her since Jim hadn""t been in the city long enough to end up on many mailing lists. Barbara, who rarely saw a catalog that didn""t have something interesting in it, received dozens of advertisements every day. The one piece of linen card stock stood out in stark contrast to the magazines, credit card offers and other junk mail. Barbara""s Trustees paid all of her major bills for her, so she didn""t receive any of the more mundane bills that the working class dreaded. Jim had been quiet about that, but she anticipated a fight or two once he settled in and wanted to pay his own fair share. She wasn""t looking forward to that argument, anymore than she was looking forward to cracking open the announcement in her left hand. She knew who it was from, and it wasn""t anyone she particularly cared for. Some things were unavoidable, unpleasant though they may have been. Jim""s cop senses were never completely turned off, and she knew he saw her hesitation. His eyes caught the way her hands paused. He was restraining himself from asking. If she wanted, she could tuck the card away and open it up in private, and Jim would never bring the topic up. She loved that about him, and it was why she chose to open it in front of him. Barbara wasn""t brave enough to talk about the past, but she could share her present with him. She slid a fingernail on the edge to break the seal, even though her mother would have been horrified that she wasn""t using a proper letter opener.",1112924
2432,"I could hear the whispers. ""Ne, ne... are Miyazawa-san and Arima-kun dating?"" ""Aren""t they a great looking couple?"" ""If Miyazawa-san starts dating Arima-kun, there""s no hope for the rest of us..."" ""They look perfect..."" We arrived at our room after talking about inconsequential things, and she thanked me for the escort before quickly heading to her desk to review her notes before class. She was such conscientious student. I sat down at my own desk, and glanced across at her. The guys who usually hung around me materialized, waiting for me to say something. Unlike usual, I voiced my actual thoughts, rather then censoring myself. ""Miyazawa-san sure is great,"" I said admiringly. ""She seems good and I can""t find any faults with her,"" I confessed. I had spent the entire night before thinking about her, wondering why I was becoming obsessed, and came to the conclusion that it was because she was everything I wanted. Perfection. The thing I sought most of all. ""Incredible that such a person exists,"" I mused, almost whispering. I had almost forgotten my audience. Two of them looked at me with disbelief and no small amount of disgust. ""HUH?"" They pouted, actually pouted. ""What are you saying, Arima?"" the first one asked. ""It""s like you""re describing about yourself,"" the second one echoed. ""Huh?"" I said. I had been thinking of Miyazawa, not myself. I did not see myself as perfect, merely as someone who worked hard to maintain a good image and good relations. They immediately started to tick off the qualities I worked so hard to present to the world. ""You topped the entrance exam!"" ""You""re great at sports!"" ""You""re handsome!"" ""Your personality is good!"" ""In all, you""re the most popular person in class!"" ""YOU""RE PERFECT, AREN""T YOU?"" they yelled, uncaring of the attention they were attracting. ""Eh?"" I said, because I was unable to think of anything saner to say. The last thing I wanted was for this uncomfortable spotlight to be shined on me. I didn""t want people to examine me too closely for fear they would see the emptiness and darkness within. One of them started yanking out his hair, and I fleetingly wondered if he was going to give himself bald patches. ""How can you be impressed by somebody else?"" he yelled, spinning around comedically The other looked at me like he thought I was nuts. ""Didn""t you know that everybody in this school knows about you, Arima?"" he asked my solicitously, the way he would have ask a man in his dotage. ""R-really?"" I stammered. I didn""t like all this attention, though it was what I was used to. I could feel Miyazawa""s eyes on me from across the room, and I wished I could explain to her that I wasn""t asking for this. I doubted that she would approve- Miyazawa didn""t strike me as the type who would approve of this sort of foolishness. ""Like a perfect match for Miyazawa-san!"" the first one declared. I could hear the hearts in his voice, and I prayed to whatever deity was listening that Miyazawa hadn""t heard him. From the tense set of her shoulders, I was willing to wager the family business she had. ""You got that right!""",1112924
1453,"Alex knew that they hated each other, but Jamila only trained with her to please their father. Jamila tried to never anger him, she feared for him if she did. Alex caught her glances all day and he""d give her a warm smile to urge her on. That""s the only reason she kept going on was because of him. He gave her hope that maybe one day she wouldn""t have to bother with this anymore. Finally when the soldiers were waved off by the girls, only then was the chance that Alex finally got to go up to Jamila""s room and sneak in to wait for her. It took a few minutes, but she finally entered. It seemed she didn""t notice him for a few minutes, but he caught her glance at him and he knew that she knew he was here with her. Jamila began to strip right in front of him as she changed into her nightclothes. Alex always loved this part, because he knew that she""d just be out of the clothes in a little while. He watched amused for a few minutes before walking up behind her and placing his hands on her shoulders as he ran them down her arms and even further. Jamila suddenly turned in his arms and smiled up at him with an all-knowing smile. ""I brought you something,"" Alex said lifting his hands to his neck. Alex pulled a necklace off his neck and put it in Jamila""s hand. Jamila looked down and smiled. It was a necklace given to him by his mother. It was made with a strong leather string, with two beads surrounding a golden Isis pendent that hung off of it. ""I had no ring, I thought this would do,"" Alex whispered as he kissed her neck and slowly took the necklace from her and placed it over her head and let it fall. ""Amun I have to tell you something,"" Jamila replied as Alex slowly pushed her back into her sleeping chambers. ""Anything my love,"" Alex whispered against her neck sending a shiver down Jamila""s spine. ""Imhotep wouldn""t do it, and he wont be here to do it much longer,"" Jamila confessed and then continued, ""We can find another way. If his plan goes wrong then we can leave together and run away with him and my mother. We can still be together, we don""t need to do what they might do."" Alex suddenly remembered his orders from the king and his anger build. He knew he had to protect Jamila, but he also had to help keep Anck-su-namun in line for the king. Alex pulled away from her and looked at her with anger in his eyes. ""What are you talking about,"" he exclaimed. ""Imhotep, he""s running away with my mother tonight. He said that if anything goes wrong that I should go to Hamunaptra and use the curse on them. He said from there we can escape to the North where the cold season lasts longer,"" Jamila said. Alex began shaking his head. ""What they are about to do is treason. I must report it,"" Alex said. As he began to walk away Jamila reached out for him making him stop in his tracks. ""And is what we were going to do not treason to,"" Jamila said sternly. ""This is different. This is the king""s bride,"" Alex replied walking back to her. ""And I am his daughter,"" Jamila dryly said out of anger. ""You are different,"" Alex replied as his voice rose. ""I""m different?",806976

I""ve been on T-cap""s Blitz for about almost a month and my brain hurts now it""s T-cap time and that makes my head hurt even more so that""s why I haven""t been writing but here""s a chapter of mine that I found that I had already finished a while back and forgot to put up so here you go enjoy my people who read this story.+New Friends+ Later in the week Dawn""s brother left after their bonding time and then she was left alone. Dominic was on a trip toward Auburn, NY to see an old friend he new back from his high school days. Tej had gone with him so Dawn was pretty much alone and bored. She was watching T.V. one day when the phone rang. She literally crawled from the back of the couch with chips still in her mouth. She quickly gulped them down as she picked up the phone and said, ""Hello."" ""Hi, is Dawn O""Connor there,"" a male voice said. ""This is her, who is this,"" Dawn asked. ""Johnny, you remember me from the motor cross Track,"" Johnny said. Across town he sat in his room with the song ""Come On Come in"" by Velvet Revolver was blaring out of his stereo. ""Oh hi, what do you want,"" Dawn voice came out of the receiver. ""Oh I was wondering if you might want to come over to my house for a while and have dinner with my friends if you have nothing else to do,"" Johnny said as Sue came into the room and slammed open the door and walked toward his radio and turned down the volume. Sue mouthed, ""Keep it down."" Johnny mouthed back, ""Whatever."" ""I guess so, my brother just went back to Miami and my friends took a trip up to Auburn and will be there for a while so I""m alone. Yeah sure that would be nice,"" came Dawn""s voice. Johnny mouthed, ""yes"" to the ceiling and threw his arms up and then brought them down in victory. He quickly remembered she was on the line and put the phone back to his ear and said, ""So what time will I pick you up."" He heard a pause and then her voice say, ""I""ll drive there just give me directions."" Johnny quickly explained to her the way to his place and then got off the phone. All the way across town at Dawn""s house she ran to her room and got ready. She tore off her sweats and put on some of her hip hugger jeans with beads all around them. She then threw on her shirt T-shirt that said, ""Girls rock,' in red beads. She also threw on her black jacket, which went with a pair of sweats she had. The design on it was tight fitting and had a mouth on the side that had it""s tongue sticking out and it was red, black and white. She put on her gold chain that her brother had given to her as a goodbye present that way she wouldn""t miss him that much. She then threw on her black tennis shoes with the same design as the jacket. She put on just a bit of make up to make her look at least a bit good. She then grabbed Dominic""s car keys to his other car, which he loaned to her since she didn""t always like driving her truck. She then grabbed her over shoulder purse and walked out of her bedroom. She walked over to the door that led outside and walked out.",806976
946,"""Have some more Tsukimori-kun."" He was hesitant at first but eventually accepted. Upon reaching the intersection where they separated, they had finished the pack of Pocky. Later, when Kahoko passed by the snacks isle in the convenience store, she smiled and instinctively deposited two packs of Strawberry-coated Pocky in her basket. Tuesday Tuesday was designated as the ""free day"" of the Concert participants when, instead of attending the afternoon practice, they would be helping with the preparations of their own classes for the cultural festival. This day was allocated as such primarily due to Third year class B""s girls constantly nagging Kanazawa-sensei if they could borrow Yunoki-sama and Hihara-kun for a while to help with the class. Hihara was a dedicated worker and his cheerfulness could do wonders to his fellow classmates especially those in the brink of fatigue (""His smile just makes you feel like you can still continue!') and Yunoki was a definite charmer and spirit-lifter even without trying. For her class, Kahoko was helping with the paper flowers to be placed at the sign outside the room. Delicately and arduously, her hand worked on perfecting the flowers she made. Her eyes critically examined the pink paper flower currently held in her hands- just a little tug here, a slight bend there. Satisfied, she smiled and just as she placed the flower with the finished ones, she felt a nudge from her classmate sitting to her left and heard a hushed squeal: ""it""s Tsuchiura-kun!' ""Hino!"" Glancing up, she saw Tsuchiura-kun smiling at her. ""Hi, Tsuchiura-kun!"" He crouched to her level and steadied the box in his arms before speaking, ""I hope you didn""t forget about our practice today."" ""Practice..? Ohh.."" She smiled as images from the first selection flashed through her mind""s eye. Tsuchiura would be her accompanist for the same piece as during the First Selection- Chopin""s Etude no. 3, opus 10, except now he agreed because he wanted to, and not because he didn""t have a choice. ""It""s at 2pm, Practice Room number 3."" His grin turned apologetic, ""Although, I can stay only until 5pm. The guys from the Soccer club had been begging me for ages to help them practice, even for just an hour or two. The Regionals are coming up soon."" Shaking her head, she reassured him, ""It""s perfectly fine, Tsuchiura-kun."" Her lips curved in a wistful smile, ""I""m really glad that it""s working out really well between you and the soccer club. Besides, I""ve been practicing really hard too so you won""t have to worry about me."" He nodded and patted her left shoulder. ""I know you do,"" his voice was gentle and understanding. The girl on Kahoko""s left blushed. Tsuchiura stood and straightened himself, ready to leave. ""See you later then, Hino."" ""Bye, Tsuchiura-kun!"" Kahoko waved at the smiling man as he rounded up the corner. Ten minutes to two in the afternoon, Kahoko was already in the practice room doing warm-ups. If there was one thing that Tsukimori-kun had instilled in her for the past days it was that warm-ups were indispensable to proper playing.",560480
480,"When he woke up it was dawn. He decided it would be best for them to shower and head out before any of the others could leave before them. Jacques guessed that the banker and the acting troupe would take advantage of the free continental breakfast. Jacques had never known an actor to turn down food before. Checking out, Jacques looked over to Olivia briefly. She was wearing a large smile, practically glowing. He knew the feeling. The clerk handed him an invoice to sign, ""Did you and your wife enjoy your stay, Mr. Snicket?"" Jacques corrected the man as he checked for any fraudulent charges, ""She""s not my wife."" He looked at Olivia, hoping she wouldn""t reject him. ""She""s my girlfriend."" Her eyes shone at him in response, making him feel fuller than he had in ages. Jacques signed the paper with a happy flourish before going out the door before they could be spotted. After the night they""d had, it was silly to pretend, so he took her hand as they walked out to the car together. He guided her to the passenger door as he took the driver""s seat. Together, they waited for the chase to begin again. Olivia drank tea with Jacques, feeling safe and secure with Olaf jailed below them and a plan to turn him over to the proper authorities, before rescuing the endangered children. She felt a warmth that was more than just the tea fill her at the sight of Jacques"" warm eyes looking at her. They heard the door open and stood immediately. The figure who walked in was dressed as a police officer, but her uniform was strangely stylish for a local person of the law. Olivia exchanged a quick glance with Jacques, who silently told her to be on her guard. He called out, ""Excuse me, but are you the chief of police?"" The woman smiled, showing far too many teeth. ""Yes, my name is Daniella Vanessa Caspian Miller. You may call me Officer Luciana."" Jacques climbed down the stairs with Olivia following. ""Officier Luciana, then, we have captured a kidnapper, arsonist, and murderer, one who would bring mayhem, chaos, and danger to your small town."" Closer to Officer Luciana now, Jacques"" eyes narrowed before he said in an astonished tone, ""Esme?"" Her mask of friendliness dropped, revealing a cruel disposition. She called out, ""Get them."" From behind them, a large bald man and a person in indeterminate gender grabbed Jacques. A man with two hooks for hands attempted to apprehend her. She ducked out of his grasp only to wind up in the clutches of two pale-faced twins. ""Gotcha,"" they said in unison. Out of the corner of her eye, Olivia watched Jacques fight off his captors. She followed suit, wrenching herself from the old ladies"" grasps. She readied herself for a fight, facing the twins. Esme sighed, bringing out something Olivia couldn""t see clearly, ""Must I do everything myself?"" She pushed a button and two wires leapt out and attached themselves to Jacques"" body. Esme pushed a button and electricity coursed through Jacques, bringing him to his knees. Another push of the button and he""d fallen down completely. In her shock, Olivia didn""t see the hook-handed man behind her.",1497577
333,";;; I snatched up the phone and backed out of the chat, hurriedly fumbling with the screen until I found the missed calls. I hit the call-back button. It rang, and rang, and rang... ""... hello?"" I swallowed thickly, ""H-hi..."" His voice was low, manly in a way, but still somehow light with a flirtatious air. Like every sentence held a hidden question or a secret want. ""Ah, English to start with I see... well then..."" Zen paused, ""The course of true love never did run smooth."" The line had me laughing in spite of myself. It was delivered perfectly, smoothly, and with the perfect air only someone who""d played the role before could manage, ""When did you play Lysander?"" ""Ah, you know it!"" He laughed. It was a bit higher than his normal voice. All easy and carefree; I could hear the smile on his face, ""The company did a production of Midsummer""s Night Dream about... oh, a year ago or so. I felt I should understand my passages in both the original English and the Korean translation to get a real feel for Lysander and his motivation, so took to practicing both."" ""I bet that was hard,"" I smiled, shifting the phone to my shoulder so I could pause the music on my computer. ""Very,"" A hint of smug pride crept into his voice, ""I needed many Korean to English dictionaries, then English to Shakespearean since, well... there""s not really a Korean equivalent for thou. Not that I could find in the dictionary, at least."" I leaned back against my couch, head resting on the cushions as I stared up at the ceiling. Such devotion to a project was... humbling, ""I want to speak Korean better. Some of it is... hard. Japanese was easier."" ""That""s the first time I""ve heard that!"" Another chuckle, this one lower that the first, ""Well then, in exchange for hearing you play, I humbly offer my services in the pursuit of increased linguistic ability!"" ""... you sound like Luciel."" He gasped and my heart leaped. It was all an act, feigning hurt, and Zen followed with a hearty laugh, ""God forbid."" We talked for hours. About this and that, our likes and our hobbies. His allergy to cats and my asthma (""I""ll never smoke anywhere near you then! And I am trying to quit; been a month strong so far!""). How he liked more simple food and drink, like beer and kebabs, while I loved anything sweet or spicy (though not together, of course. Sweet and spicy just tasted... weird). I hadn""t talked so much in months, and every Korean flub I made was greets with a gentle chuckle, a soft correction, and I swear he was winking at me on the other line. I don""t know how I knew it, he just was. It was his voice. He loved the stage, more than air, than breathing, more than life itself. In Zen""s eyes, without music and dancing and the stage, there was nothing in life. I smiled at that, knowing exactly what that felt like, albeit a bit different in my case. I couldn""t live without my music, my paintings, and dancing. ""Do you want to hear a bit of the lines I was practicing?"" He asked, ""It""s from the Phantom of the Opera; the director""s been wanting to do it for ages."" ""Oh, let me guess... you play Raoul.""",748687
3486,"Devon muttered something before grunting, ""Sure, we""ll take him to the rink, and watch him spin like a sparkly little pussy."" ""Careful, Mister Brace. I would have for your supply to run out."" A short pause. ""We""ll hang out with Junior tomorrow."" Vance smiled coldly. ""Good."" After hanging up, he turned on the hidden camera in his son""s room. He saw Junior enter, and throw things in disarray, his backpack knocking the laptop on his desk off the edge and under his bed. He kicked off his Timberlands, threw his Rolex to the dresser and stripped off his blazer and dress shirt. Vance sighed. ""Teenagers... so hard to control them."" AK: Ladies and gentlemen, the most helicopter parent ever! Sorry I""ve been gone so long. Sophomore year is hectic. I may start doing just the bi-monthly updates. Max was surprised to see her former boss again, this time near her more frequented cafe. ""Mr. Colter, what a pleasant surprise."" she chirped despite the utter bafflement she felt. ""Maxine, please, call me Vance."" He smiled a smile that didn""t quite seem realistic. ""We are old acquaintances, now. Not boss and employee."" ""I""ll do that..."" Max replied diplomatically. ""What brings you to my side of Gotham?"" ""An overseas investor of mine is staying in Gotham Towers, and suggested lunch to look over a renewal of funding."" Vance replied. ""Ah,"" Max said relieved somewhat. Now she wouldn""t have to spend time with him. ""Then I won""t keep you."" She moved to go around him to go into the trendy coffee shop. ""However, I could use your opinion on something."" Vance""s words stopped her. ""Yes?"" Max asked, sidestepping a small trickle of customers from the coffee shop. ""Is there a nice and safe place for our meeting? A nice restaurant you recommend?"" Max sighed inwardly. Of course, she thought. ""Magnolia""s on 8th Street is pretty nice. And the Lounge has a very safe atmosphere."" ""Go Angie!"" cheered Ricky from the sidelines at Central Rink. Lexi and the girls were watching as Angie and her new Spoke Hydraulic hover-blades showed the Stephen and Jared what it meant to tear up the obstacle track. It was Angie""s birthday, and for it, the gang had chipped in to buy her the new skates- which the girl had not-so-subtly told them she wanted. Like, she told them every week since the beginning of the month. As it was the group""s tradition to pool money and buy one gift, rather than they all try and outdo each other, there was several cards with the one present. Angie had lit up like a megawatt TV set light at seeing the hover-blades, and promptly decreed a birthday celebration at Central to break them in. Stephen and the ever competitive Jared had stepped up to show their mettle against the birthday girl, after everyone else bowed out. As they trio on the private obstacle course neared the line that would signal the fourth and final lap, Lexi""s stomach grumbled. Julie frowned, looking over at her friend. ""Did you feed that thing before we came?"" Lexi shrugged. ""I""ll feed it now. Want anything? ""she asked the group. ""Nachos, large."" Angie yelled over the screen as she passed.",3439302
604,"To his great surprise, the Emperor burst out laughing; long, loud, hearty laughter that boomed through the continent wide halls of the Sacred Palace. Horus found himself paralyzed by the laughter for how sincere it sounded. Volume aside, this could have been the laughter of any ordinary man and for a few moments longer Horus was paralyzed by the hope that his father wasn""t the force of pure evil that he""d proven himself to be. When the laughter died down, the Emperor smiled once more at Horus; the smile however did not reach his unblinking eyes. ""Thank you, Horus. I haven""t laughed like that in . . . well I don""t know how long. Honestly sometimes I just forget, kind of like I""m just making up everything as I go. Some days I don""t remember . . . anything."" There was a flicker in the emperor""s eyelids, a sort of partial wink; maybe a thought went across his mind before being quickly forgotten. Casually, he threw his half smoked cannabis cigarette into his half drained wine glass. The Emperor""s voice turned stereotypically solemn, like what people would imagine a disappointed god would say; only the glittering, unblinking eyes stayed the same. In the corner, Russ had stopped screaming and was twitching in a pool of his own vomit, blood and tears. ""Horus, you took to defying me. You took half of your brothers in rebellion against the loyalists and against me. The last seven years of war have seen more human being killed than have ever been born in history up to this point; but that""s not what makes me really upset, Horus. No, what makes me really upset beyond words is that you""ve shown compassion, that you don""t hate me, that you don""t fear me."" The God Emperor of mankind stood up, brushing off imaginary cigarette ashes from his black slacks. Turning around, he looked at the four glass bottles on top of the golden throne, each one containing one of the dreaded chaos gods. Slaanesh, Tzeetch, Khorne and Nurgle. ""Horus,"" said the Emperor, tapping a finger playfully on the glass bottles holding the most terrible beings in the universe, ""If you had been afraid of me I would not have been forced to siphon off some chaos energy and turn your traitorous brothers into chaos fuelled monsters. It""s your fault Horus that I let chaos into the world. If you were afraid then you would have just followed the Imperial creed of atheism, science and obedience and all of this could have been avoided."" At this point, Horus burst out in anger at his so called father. ""DON""T TRY TO TURN THIS AROUND ON ME!"" The Warmaster pointed an accusing finger at the master of mankind, ""You committed genocide against any human group that would not obey you in totality, you allowed poverty, disease and ignorance to thrive on countless feral and feudal worlds, under your reign the hive worlds have rotted into crime and degeneracy while squeezing them of their resources to feed a few core worlds!

1917,"She felt like a silk blanket as the beautiful yet deadly creature laid her body on top of his. The warmth he felt was so calming, he couldn""t help himself. The touch of someone temperate reassured him. The back of his mind screamed at him, ""Stop! You""ll regret this! You will...' and yet, his body was too tired to care. His mind was exhausted, overexerted and ran through the mill as he found and lost his true love in one glorious day. The words of love he longed to hear from Yuuri rang in his ears, over and over again. It wouldn""t leave him alone; dogging him, pestering him only to point out the hopelessness he felt in his life right now.

Take control - and, make it a safer place to live. Under your reign: as the greatest king since the times of the Original King.""

1719,"To say Germany was ""alive"" was being generous at best, lying as worst. Tears stung at my eyes as I stared at my friend in shock. He was propped up by pillows against the wall and in bed, blankets and sheets pulled around him. I could see that he had done his best to hide his state before we came in, but there was no covering the mess of torn flesh that was Germany. He was shirtless, and every inch of exposed skin was hacked up like he had been thrown in a meat grinder. What wasn""t cut up was covered in bandages, and some parts of Germany had taken on the off-green tone of infection. There was a large wound on his neck that looked like it had been hastily bandaged recently, and blood was already seeping through the bandage. He looked barely lucid, eyes half-lidded and breath coming out in pained, ragged gasps. He sounded so pained that broken ribs were probably part of the long list of injuries covering his body. Germany""s hair was splattered with blood, along with his bed and all of his body, and his head was bandaged to cover up a nasty wound. The bandages on his head extended down, covering his right eye as well. He looked so worn, so utterly spent, yet even in his near-death state, Germany had a smile. A small, genuinely happy smile for Italy and Italy alone. He looked like he wanted to take the trembling and tearful Italy into his arms and tell him everything would be okay. It wasn""t even possible for Germany to properly hug the Italian in his state. He was missing his entire right arm, after all. All that was left of the limb was a tightly bandaged stump of a shoulder, and I sobbed at the sight of it and what my strong friend had become. The I.V. drip must be painkillers than, because most of the wounds were either fresh, or refusing to heal. How was Germany even alive? It didn""t seem possible to me. He had so many injuries, he was so pale, and there was just so much blood. ""Mon dieu... Ludwig..."" I managed to choke out as Switzerland closed the door behind us. How had this happened? Who had done this to Germany? His gaze didn""t leave Italy, probably because even moving his head would strain something, but he spoke to both of us, ""... been... a-about thirt... een years, ""asn""t... i... t...?"" ""Ludwig..."" Italy sobbed. His shoulders shook, he buried his head in his hands, and wailed. Austria, Switzerland, and I started, and I was about to tell Italy to keep his voice down when he launched himself at Germany. He got to Germany before anyone could stop him and pulled the critically injured man into a huge. ""Feliciano, stop!"" Austria commanded when Germany cried out in pain. Italy jumped away from our German friend when he yelled, eyes wide. Germany winced and fell forward, gripping his bloody stump with a pained expression. Switzerland and Austria jumped to his side wearing identical masks of worry. Austria forced Germany back and Switzerland immediately checked that the flow to the I.V. hadn""t been disrupted by Italy""s outburst. Seeing that it hadn""t, he rounded on Italy, ""That""s vhy I didn""t vant to bring you!""",748687
3458,"""Anyway,"" Edward continued, ""I was out buying cheese and I found this one type of cheddar that I""m very partial to."" Peter honestly had no idea where this was going; he was just waiting for the inevitable train wreck. ""So I went home and I started to put away my groceries,"" Edward took a sip of his tea and lay the cup back down. ""Then I was hungry and I felt the need to make myself a sandwich."" ""Yeah, sure,"" said Peter, who was by now way out of his depth in terms of the comfort department. Edward went on with his seemingly bland story, ""So I got out the bread, which was a little stale and a bit mouldy, and I got out the mustard and then when I had all I needed I realized I needed a butter knife."" As Edward rambled, Peter just blinked; his face becoming an unreadable mask of ""Oh, Christ on a stick!"" ""So I finally got the butter knife to but the bread because my break knife was rusty,"" Edward sucked in a rasping, deep breath as if about to burst into tear. ""Then I opened the package of cheese and it smelled just like Jasper""s crotch."" Edward""s green eyes glistened with tears and turned red from grief that was still raw, ""And then I cried and cried for an hour until I became dehydrated."" His lower lip trembled and Peter""s mind went completely blank. The macho Greek just stared at Edward with a look of utter, unimaginable, hellish incredulity belonging to man who""s heard way too much and then was forced to hear some more. As Peter stood still as a shell-shocked war veteran, Edward""s shoulders and chest began to shake; but he was not crying. No, Edward was laughing hysterically and mechanically as if he had no more tears left to shed. His high, tittering laughter was so unlike any kind of laughter the man had ever uttered before. After only a few seconds of hearing Edward""s high pitched, desperate laughter, he""d had enough. ""I""m going to the liquor store,"" said Peter in a monotone. He stood up and pushed his chair back in. ""You want anything?"" ""Gin!"" Edward choked out between laughs. Peter walked out the door and closed it without saying goodbye, he""d return with hard alcohol before long. As he ran towards his car and sped out of Edward""s driveway in ways that were both illegal and unsafe, he pulled out his cell phone and made a call to Edward""s parents. They could handle this and keep the guy from offing himself. Peter sped down the road, cutting across two lanes of traffic and losing a hubcap while he was at it. Meanwhile, Edward was still laughing hysterically. Nearly choking himself, he stood up shakily to go and brew another pot of tea. As he stumbled in his laughing frenzy, Edward accidently walked into the kitchen door, which had been open and was facing Edward at a perpendicular angle. ""Ow!"" Edward squeaked as he walked into the unyielding door. The whole room seemed to spin around Edward and his feet seemed to be stepping on ice. He had no idea how it happened, but in a nanosecond of time, Edward found himself slamming down onto the kitchen floor and darkness took him.",1220273
3804,"This fanfic was inspired by something I saw online that I just realized, I guess the fairies need to check up in ""Da Rules"" throughly or else this would happen... ""Due to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that this chapter in no way endorses underage drinking."" -Technomaru- Despite what the Thriller warning parody says, I am against underage drinking and this is not meant to be taken seriously until the final chapter.

Timmy got so ""fit-shaced"" enough to come up with a very convincing plan to get rid of her forever... Timmy then drinks a bottle of ""Elsinor Beer"" and makes a call on the telephone and says in a faux-whining voice, ""... I want to report my babysitter... she...she...she ""molestered"" me! And she plans on doing it to me again tonight! Oh and search her for evidence please!"" Wanda flies towards Timmy with Poof in her arms and asks, ""Timmy... what exactly are you up to?"" Timmy then makes a sinister toothy grin and says, ""Now we play the waiting game!"" Wanda rolls her eyes and says to herself, ""If I was in charge of that fairy rulebook, I""d make it easer to read than that ""handbook for the recently deceased"" Timmy turns on the TV and the announcer then says in a sexy sultry voice, ""Up next on the Naughty Boy channel it""s Ashley Ketchem and Misty Waters starring in ""Poke-a-man""... and then it""s the classic 3D0 game made into a movie, ""Plumbers don""t wear ties"" This is the Naughty Boy channel and boy are you naughty!""

Boygirl then says"" It""s already too late, I""ve worked for you for a long time and I""m payed less than Tomboy.

Rhine shrieked, banging her fist on the wooden table. Her rough breathing suggests that her patience would not last long. Takeshi sighed and shook his head. He knew Rhine very well... especially how she hates people who prefer indirect reasoning. The expression was clear. Onizuka was up to something and Kikuchi didn""t like the air around. The computer genius surveyed his teacher, but, unluckily, he didn""t get any more clues to what a certain blonde was planning... Onizuka""s smirk widened. Rhine narrowed her eyes at this sudden change of behavior. Pulling herself back all together, she calmly sat back down. Kanzaki could have also noticed Onizuka""s change of behavior for the smirk on her face faltered a little. ""It seems Onizuka is up to something that would help Kikuchi in this situation. Too bad. I would really love to piss Kikuchi off with all my aces, right now..' Sighing, she let her eyes rest on his. ""Hey, sensei, you quiet? What""s the matter?"" Murai asked playfully. Seeing the teacher""s expression, he raised an eyebrow. Okay, so, basically, we all know now that Onizuka is planning something. An anticipating air hung around the restaurant. Whether it""s due to the gravity of the situation or over reacted-ness of the audience, we""ll never know. All eyes managed to land themselves on a certain teacher who started to smoke his second cigarette butt. Noticing that he managed to attract all attention due to his change of behavior, Onizuka silently congratulated himself. ""Well, I only have one thing to say,"" he started, his voice completely professional-like, ""that my arm made the wrong move. You see, my arm was directed to the wrong direction- thus making the wrong angle..."" Some people raised their eyebrows. ""Could you please get to the point?"" Rhine asked in a dangerous tone. It seems she her patience was starting to collapse. Onizuka kept cool. ""I was planning to, if you haven""t interrupted, that is."" Rhine clenched her fist. ""Anyway, to make it short, Nakamura Tomoko isn""t Kikuchi Yoshito""s girlfriend at all."" Gasps where heard. Kikuchi""s eyes widened. ""What.the.heck.I.don""t.like.the.sound.of.this.' ""Then... who is it...?"" Fuyutsuki-sensei asked, quite interested on how Onizuka could stir up a plan within a few minutes- well, whether the plan was foolproof or not, she doesn""t have any idea. Onizuka silently enjoyed the thrill that hung from the air. He was planning to make his pause longer if only he didn""t feel Rhine""s boiling anger that radiated off the girl. ""She is..."" He raised his arm and pointed at a certain girl with blonde hair and a pair of striking ocean blue and chocolate brown eyes. Kanzaki Urumi.

1556,"""Oh yes, I almost forgot, you""ve been pitching yourself around in the library. Found anything interesting on love."" He laid back into his hands in a relaxed manner taking a deep breath and closing his eyes. ""In fact I have. My favorite to be truthful would be that of Hades and-"" She stopped herself, it would encourage the man too much. She looked down at herself, she felt clean and undeniably soft. ""What have you done to me?"" ""You smelled of puke."" He spat, she bit her bottom lip out of embarrassment. ""I ordered my servants to undress you and wash you while I attended to my kingly duties."" ""Hmmm... But you didn""t see me naked."" ""Look at yourself now."" He blurted out in suppressed laughter, she realized she had ridden herself of the sheet. She nearly fell back the chain keeping her up, Loki snatched her wrist and pulled her back onto the bed. ""Listen. Take me home... I just want to be home."" She begged while gazing into his eyes, Loki wove his fingers through hers and held them close. His hand was cold and unwelcoming, but she didn""t mind. She realized that the cold weather was always and anything having to do with it. ""I""m afraid I can""t do that. I made the mistake of letting you go years ago. Now that I am king I plan on reuniting Midgard and Asgard with our marriage."" ""Why me though? I know I look like her, but... I don""t want this."" He growled at the pit of his throat releasing her hand and swinging up from the bed with a snap of his fingers he was fully clothed in his signature green armor with his helmet atop his head. ""You are my slave now Ava. I do what I wish with you. The servants will be in here to pick you up for dinner and perhaps another bath would due."" Ava felt herself glare at the stone cold king as he entered back across the room and exited it through the royal oak doors. She had never felt this scared in her life, she of course tried not to show it, but- At least she will be able to use her magic when the chains came off. She nodded to herself with confidence, all she needed to do was teleport and leave. That was it, just leave, perhaps this would be easier than expected. When the servants arrived she couldn""t have been more wrong, they were instructed by their Clever king to cuff her left wrist with a bracelet of sorts before releasing your ankle. It put mountains of stress on her, knowing that she""d be having dinner with the most hated man in Midgard. She tried to understand what made him even consider making amends with the human race. The dress that was chosen for her was prettier than anything she had ever worn in her life, obviously. It was thin around her waist, going down between her breasts. The sleeves finishing at her wrists and fit tightly to her arms. The skirt ended at her knees, of course it had to be green. She was led down a long corridor and urged into a room where a table stood. Food plates went up and down the table in exotic wonder, large meats and tankards, bowls of soup and salad.",6234395
2062,"She helped me down the stairs and all the way to my nice comfy bed. Pulling the covers back she helped me in. I managed to kick off my shoes and then swing my legs on into the bed. Sara pulled the covers over me before she reached into her pocket and pulled out a bottle of medicine. ""The doctor said this should help with what just happened upstairs, not to mention it would help you rest better. Here, take one,"" Sara ordered me as she handed me the medicine. Without arguing I threw it into my mouth and swallowed. Sara leaned down and kissed me on my forehead before she whispered a quiet ""sweet dreams.' I watched her do the same thing to Matt, before she left. I watched as Matt turned his gaze upon me, but I didn""t have time to register his facial expression before my eyes closed tight and I drifted off into a deep sleep. I stood in Wendy""s room looking out the window at the beautiful sunny day. The whole world seemed to glow with a happiness that managed to seep into your very core. A happiness no one could ever ruin even if they tried. I felt arms wrap around my waist and I instantly recognized the person by their touch. I leaned into them and breathed in their aura. The arms around me pulled away after a few moments though, but soon another took my head as they led me away from the window. Turning around I saw Jonah as he led me over to the bed. Taking a seat on the bed he pulled me closer to him. So close, that I had no choice, but to straddle him as he kept pulling me. Leaning upwards Jonah cupped his hand around my cheek and pulled me closer to his lips, and for once I held no objection to this action. I let his lips brush mine sweetly, before they trailed their way down my neck. It wasn""t up until that moment that I realized I was in a white, low cut sundress. The same sundress I had worn a year ago for my senior pictures. ""Don""t leave,"" came Jonah""s agonizing whisper, as he trailed his kisses back up my neck and to my lips. I went to tell him I wouldn""t, but I already felt the pull. The same pull that always seemed to bring me back to reality. ""I""m sorry,"" I whispered to him before the dream, and Jonah""s face blackened as my eyes opened. When my eyes snapped open the person I saw standing above me, was not who I was expecting. In truth I was expecting to see Jonah, but instead I found Matt. ""What""s wrong,"" I asked as I leaned up bed. He just shook his head before he took my covers and pulled them down. Jumping into my bed, without a word, he covered us back up. I continued to stare at him questioningly as he closed his eyes and pulled me closer to him. So close that it felt as if he was crushing me. ""What""s wrong,"" I whispered once more. Without missing a beat he whispered, ""You were whispering his name in your sleep."" My eyes widen as his slowly opened. Our gazes locked and he could see the guilt in mine, while I could see the sadness in his. ""I""m sorry, Matt. It""s not like I have control..."" ""I know, but he does,"" Matt growled as his eyes took on anger. He closed his eyes, and somehow managed to pull me in even closer.",806976
564,"Others would believe in Mario Pepper""s guilt since sometimes the scariest thing about life on the underside of Gotham was that freak things did happen, and maybe the police had nailed the right guy. There was never going to be a trial, so the police wouldn""t have to prove anything. There was no way Ivy Pepper was going to emerge from this mess without a rep of some kind. As she walked down the hallway, she headed to the science classroom. Like all of the rooms, the classroom was packed with people. Usually more than a quarter of the students assigned to this class played hookey, but today attendance numbers were notably higher. She felt like the main attraction at a circus as she marched straight forward, taking her place next to a fish tank. The tank was completely full of algae, a mass that had been growing for years and existed for ""educational purposes."" The students knew the real reason was that their teacher Marc LaGrande couldn""t be bothered to maintain it, but the school wouldn""t let him get rid of the equipment provided by the Wayne Foundation a decade ago. Ivy found staring at the algae calming. It was a constant in a roomful of aggressive students who didn""t want to be there, and a teacher who had given up on being an educator a week after meeting his first class. On the good days, the students would ignore the educational videos that LaGrande put on as he sat his ass behind his desk, and play with their electronic device of choice or talk with friends. On the bad days, there would be fights over stupid crap like stealing boyfriends or for pride. Ivy hadn""t been dragged into one of those fights before because her dad would have kicked the ass of anyone who hurt her, even if they were a little kid. Mario Pepper had been a mean son of a bitch who wasn""t afraid to smack his family around, but he""d made sure he was the only one allowed to do the smacking. As the bell rang, Ivy thought about what she would do if someone decided to come after her. She might even welcome the chance to lash out. She would get away with it, too, because the school administration and Social Services would let her slide if she wasn""t the one to start things. Despite the classroom being overcrowded, people managed to avoid sitting next to her. Ivy gave a couple of the ones closest to her long, unblinking looks, and watched as they tried to sidle even farther from her chair. The entire day went like that, with the other students careful to give her plenty of personal space. She had never been popular, but she hadn""t been a pariah before. Ivy wanted someone to say something, anything, that would give her an excuse to retaliate, but no one at school made a move. By the end of the school day, she was livid. The student body of GS 113 was a model of an inner city school afflicted with urban decay, but not a single person dared give her the opportunity to vent a bit of her anger. The other students were all wimps. They were treating her like she was poisonous just because they were scared that she might infect them with something.",1112924
2647,"She and Pete had left it to Rose to show the Doctor his new home - there was a lot of room in Pete""s house, even more now, since Mickey had chosen to stay on earth and he had always had a room kept for him in the house. When the Doctor finally came to a halt in the living room, he sat down on the couch, and Rose joined him there. He immediately slipped arm around her shoulder and drew her close, an oddly familiar gesture. ""I still can""t believe this,"" he said. ""You and me, here... me settling down..."" ""You being human in the first place..."" Rose added with a smirk. She leaned her head against his chest. ""It""s odd, not hearing a second heartbeat."" ""It""s odd, not being thrown off the couch by turbulence,"" he countered. Rose looked up at him. ""Aren""t you gonna miss it?"" she asked. ""The TARDIS... travelling... all that?"" He sighed.

His fingers were trembling slightly as he put a hand under her chin to lift up her face until their eyes were level. ""I love you, Rose Tyler,"" he said softly. ""I remember not being able to say it - not being familiar with the whole concept... And now it""s all new and strange. When I look at you, I feel younger and lighter and more alive than ever. It""s as if I could start to float any second. And I only want to be with you and never let you go. Is that how human love really feels?"" He sounded almost anxious. Rose pulled him in an embrace.

2549,"Dio chuckled and relaxed. Jin sighed in relief at that. The boy was like a hermit crab, who kept going in and out of its shell. He needed to find a way get the introvert to be relaxed around them. Jin""s relief was short-lived however, when he heard a sickening crunch beside him and as he turned towards Dio with a shocked expression, the boy was spitting out his food into the sand with a pained and choking expression. ""Dio!"" Jin rubbed the boy""s naked, wondering if he choked on the lobster meat. He stared at the food that was spat and was irked when he saw the meat and a whole lot of the shell of the lobster""s claw. ""You idiot."" Jin chastised, as he bought Dio""s chin up towards him. ""Why the hell would you eat the shell along?"" Dio""s face exhibited pure surprise. ""I...you""re not supposed to eat that?"" He reddened again at his mistake. ""You goof."" Jin sighed, but he then smiled reassuringly as he picked the pieces of whatever shell remained in Dio""s chin and at the corner of his lips. ""Ow..."" Dio cringed, as he began moving his tongue inside his mouth. ""Here."" Jin took Dio by the chin again and nudged his mouth open with his index finger. ""There""s a piece of shell sticking in your tongue..."" Jin stared at his fingers. ""Eh...they""re dirty...what to do? I can""t use my hands to get it out..."" ""Is something wrong with him?""

Sieghart tilted his head sideways, looking pensive. ""Hey, what was your name again?"" Sieghart turned towards Dio. Said boy took a glance at Jin, asking for approval. Jin nodded, mouthing ""It""s okay."" ""D-Dio..."" He replied, cringing when he moved his tongue to speak. ""Dio, I need you - "" Seighart tilted Dio""s chin to face him. "" - I need you to open your mouth so I can see where the piece is."" Said boy somehow took a pace back, but Sieghart held Dio""s chin in a steadfast grip, though the boy still refused to open his mouth. ""Now Jin."" Sieghart sighed exasperatingly. ""Please tell your boyfriend to open his mouth for me."" Jin sputtered from drinking his soda in a can, as he stared at Sieghart with Coke still dripping from his mouth and nose. ""H-he""s not my boyfriend!"" Dio immediately turned towards Jin. ""We""re not?"" Jin looked surprised at the clarity and tone of the question. For a second there, he was just getting used to Dio""s stuttering and shyness. But there was this overwhelming will from those two words and - ""I-it""s not like you asked me out yet."" Jin retorted, but then covered his mouth in shock to avoid shooting himself in the foot once more. ""Bu - "" Dio was about to answer back when his face got turned around and found himself lip locking with Sieghart.",583064

1670,"The old woman placed her free hand on top of Satine""s and Obi-Wan felt as though he should look away, like he was intruding on an intensely private moment. Too soon, the brief minute of shared grief had passed, and the two women began to chat about lighter topics. Obi-Wan found his mind wandering. Not far though, as it remained firmly fixed on the woman beside him. No matter which way he looked at it, she was an anomaly. In the course of his padawan training, he had encountered numerous politicians from all over the galaxy, but none of them were like her. In his experience, politicians were loud, brash, and domineering. That, he supposed, was the standard in a democratic system where one had to participate in a certain level of self-promotion in order to get elected. Perhaps her differences-her softness and quiet dignity-could be attributed to her inherited title, then, but that didn""t sit right with Obi-Wan either. She was so much more than her birthright, interacting with her subjects as a friend, not a ruler. There was something infuriating about her. Never had he met someone so stubborn and intransigent, a person who was fundamentally good, yet fiercely critical of the Jedi Order. Qui-Gon handled it better than Obi-Wan, smiling at her critiques and softly correcting misconceptions. No doubt it was due in part to his Master""s own issues with the Jedi Council. Obi-Wan on the other hand, would get annoyed and too blustered to properly argue. He""d stand there awkwardly, unable to come up with a good answer. He couldn""t stand it-despite everything, some part of him wanted to impress her. With that thought, quiet warning bells went off his in head. ""Well, Ben?"" Her words jerked him back into reality. She was smiling up at him, and It took Obi-Wan a minute to respond to the name Satine had taken to calling him when they were in public. ""Huh?"" The old woman chuckled and muttered something to the Duchess in Mando""a, which Obi-Wan took to mean something along the lines of: ""men."" ""Think this is enough?"" Satine gestured to the counter of the booth, and Obi-Wan saw that there was a sizable portion of food stacked up. For the second time in as a many minutes, Obi-Wan""s cheeks burned as he realized that he had effectively tuned out their entire purpose in coming to town. He quickly muttered his assent, and, not meeting the old woman""s amused eyes, helped Satine load the food into their packs. Once they had finished, Satine reached into her pocket and pulled out a number of Mandalorian coins and tried to hand them to the old woman. The woman refused the full amount, instead selecting two of the smaller ones from the Duchess""s hand and pocketing those. Satine tried to argue, but the old woman leaned back on her stool and smiled, holding firmly to her position. ""It""s the least I can do to help young love,"" she said, winking at Obi-Wan.",2943978
2957,"""Arya, please,"" Sansa rolled her eyes, obviously used to that sort of comeback from her sister. She faced me full on then, ""The wars and the undead changed a lot of us. Tell me, Synne; how did the war affect you, so far south? I""ve never been to Dorne; the furthest south I""ve gone was when I stayed in King""s Landing with our father."" Ned Stark. The former Lord of Winterfell who was beheaded as a traitor and later exonerated and hailed a hero. I couldn""t even begin to imagine what it was like, losing a father like that, ""It... to be honest, the war didn""t much reach Dorne. I remember when Princess Myrcella stayed there before she died, but that was a long ways from where I lived. None of the battles ever really reached us, or any of the infighting after the Sand Snakes were imprisoned. Now, we just have most of the Dothraki, though they""ve settled more east and north from home."" ""I hope you know how lucky that makes you, Synne,"" Seeing my surprise, Sansa went on, ""We stopped the Night King and his army here. And many of us sacrificed a lot for that to happen. The nobles, the soldiers, the low-born, everyone."" ""We did lose, too,"" I said, ""The entire power structure of Dorne was wiped out. I-I don""t know much of what happened, but I heard some terrible things in town about the power struggle in the last few years between the rest of the Dornish noble houses over who would rule after the Martell""s."" Sansa opened to mouth to interject, but I kept going, ""But yeah, you""re right. The war didn""t reach us; it was mostly in the North and the Vale. But..."" I bit my lip. Tyrion""s words, an age ago it felt, reminded me not to make enemies of all the nobles. ""I know that look,"" Sansa said, usually severe expression softening, ""You can speak free here."" ""My mother was forced to work in a brothel for ten years against her will and was assaulted and raped every day. I... I had to listen to it, all the way up until we fled to the farm,"" I""d blurted the words out so quickly that a few ran together, and took a deep breath to calm myself, ""And then... I watched my mother die. I think, well... I think that everyone""s lost a lot. But... comparing everything terrible that""s happened in your life to mine isn""t really fair to either of us."" She raised an eyebrow, and for a moment her knowing expression reminded me of Bran. They were definitely siblings, ""Oh?"" ""I-I don""t want to assume, but... I mean, everyone reacts differently to a situation,"" I said, ""You had a lot of people all around you all your life, and you lost a lot of them. For twenty years all I really had was my mother. And then I lost her. It""s like... neither of those is really worse than the other; you""ve lost, and I""ve lost. We""ve both dealt and are still dealing with it, just like all the people around us. And... if we start comparing tragedies, it just turns into a contest of angst that no one ever wins."" Sansa smiled, ""Then what do you suppose we do then? Us women, who""ve both lost much and dealt with it in our own ways?""",748687

441,"Brick snickered. ""No one does. But if I could understand Spitfire, I""d turn myself into a monk for life. Or six days."" He elicited a giggle from her; a half hearted one at best. Suddenly, something scratched at the window behind them. Turning to see who it was, Bloss gasped and bolted upright, pushing him to the floor in the process. ""Luna; you came back!"" Scratching the back of his head, Brick eyed the cat who was currently being coddled and cooed over by his girlfriend. Was it any wonder he was jealous of the cat, when it got kisses rained on it just for showing up with a rose in its mouth and ruining perfectly sweet a moment. ""Aw... You brought me a rose. How sweet. You""re so smart and thoughtful... Let""s go get a vase for it. We""ll be right back, Brick-y-whicky."" She gave him a peck on the lips, and with Luna the Cupid-Cat in arms, she flew out. He sat there dumbfounded. Then, he leaned his head back against the wall in defeat. The cat was a blessing and a curse. AnimeKitty: Blossom loves cats, don""t you Blossom?

Even though they were becoming siblings in less than five days, Rio was still too close to Bloss for Brick""s taste. The red-head had to have a thing for Bloss. And the present stunt he""d pulled the last time they""d had a date was still a burning thorn in Brick""s- ""Oh, Rio, are you sure we have to cut the Tango? I mean Professor""s really been practicing..."" ""Hey, we""re all still doing it. Just... Well, mom""s kind of got this thing about doing the Tango in front of all our aunts: they have nothing but snarky things to say."" Rio replied. ""So, we""re still going to light up the dance floor... Just, minus one newlywed couple."" Bloss nodded, petting Luna absently. The traitorous cat mewled and reached out to Rio, who scooped it up. ""But the slide show""s going great! All I need is that photo album you promised. Then we can wrap this up in time before our extended families collide."" They both shuddered. Finally, Brick intruded on the bubble of intimacy he could see forming. ""Bloss,"" he started. The red-head, fortunately for him, recognized supremacy when he heard it. Rio tickled under Luna""s chin and handed her back to Bloss. ""I better jet; gotta drop off some invites before dance practice. Later, Sakura."" The minute Rio-the-red-headed-wonder left, Brick pulled Bloss into his lap. She squeaked. Wrapping his arms around her, he buried his face in the strawberry scented crook of her neck. He growled. ""You smell nice."" Good one Einstein... You sound like a Neanderthal.",3439302

253,"Nya finally looked up at Schmidt, he glanced at her, almost disappointed. He saw the red hand print on her face and it angered him, but the fact that she did nothing about it made him question his confidence in her. ""Nya had to tell you something."" Hetz said, he glared at Nya expectantly. Nya""s expression wrinkled, she sniffled and pierced Hetz with her own stern gaze. No, Not fragile. She took a deep breath and bit her bottom lip. ""Is there something wrong, Ms. Fateze?"" She nodded her head silently, no words were exchanged for the longest time. Schmidt scowled and shook his head. ""I have no time for this."" He growled, starting back to the door. ""I am not one to rat another out..."" She whispered, but it caused him to pause. His hand gripping the brass knob in a threatening and testy manner. ""So I won""t, but I wanted to say that..."" She cleared her throat and gazed back at Hetz, without breaking his gaze she said, ""I am proud of the position you have offered me and I will except it. Thank you."" Johann tried to contain the smile at the look on Hetz"" face. ""It must be the choice of the gods."" Johann said as a matter of fact before pouring out of the office to do his bidding. The next day a bruise had formed on her face and Hetz did everything he could to evade her. She was happy for once. The day after she was moved into Schmidt""s office, a desk that was hidden at the corner of the room, facing his own. It was no longer mere glances, he asked for her opinion on a majority of things and even held short topical conversations with her. He was a lot more kind than she had expected him to be. He smiled at her on a daily basis. A month passed and Schmidt was sent to Berlin for a business meeting with Hitler. Schmidt had insisted that she leave with him, she accepted without hesitation. It made her wonder why he had chosen her, instead of someone more qualified for the job. She had never asked because it was so rewarding to work alongside Hydra""s leader. But on the plane ride to Berlin, it made her wonder more than anything. In Berlin, the hotel room was extravagant. It wasn""t far from the town hall where Schmidt would be expected the following day. They were placed in a suite that had two separate rooms, one bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. The floors were carpeted in green felt and the walls painted a maroon red. The beds were king size and made of oak, the sheets a startling mix between beige and dark brown. Each room contained a tall mirror and a wardrobe. Schmidt took the room to the left of the bathroom door, not that it really mattered. The rooms were practically duplicates, but probably the nicest thing that she had slept in in years. That was the night that everything has changed. Schmidt left the room to go and handle business, she went to take a shower. It was a long shower considering that the water was actually warm and the soap didn""t smell like cardboard. The barracks at Hydra were never probably fixed together, there were only her and three other woman on base so they didn""t care to make another shower room.",6234395
487,"Then there was one I could not place. Somewhere in the middle of a triangle of sadness, shock, and disgust. Seventeen children... that meant that their mother, Nephilim, had to have been pregnant one after another for nearly thirteen years. From the time she was ten. Was she raped? ""Of course... she wouldn""t have...' My thoughts trailed off. Thirteen years... would she even look the same? Marred beyond recognition, body battered and broken from the weight of constant pregnancy? According to the letter, another child was on the way... that""s meant that, somewhere, she was alive. Alive and carrying a possible twentieth child. The largest and most frightening emotion that took an unshakable hold in my heart was rage. An undiluted, pure desire for destruction. To destroy anything, anyone, just to vent out the horrid twist of emotions surging unblocked through my veins. I was seeing red; my breath was hitched and labored. The fault line down the center of my body rippled from the sheer pain of my rage. Anger at myself, Nephilim, Smith, the BAU, cultists, the world, and all it""s inhabitants. My fists were clenched so tightly that I felt a slight pinch as my nails cut into the flesh. ""Spence! Reid!"" ""Let him go, J.J."" ""And let him go assault our only lead?! Spencer!"" Someone put their hand on my arm; I twisted to tear myself away from their grasp. Assault the lead? Assault Smith? Not that bad of an idea, now that I thought on it... Another hand gripped my arm, harder this time. I couldn""t shake it off so easily, so I swung around to face whomever it was, intent on getting them off of me. ""Reid, Reid, calm down,"" Morgan""s grip on me arm tightened. I couldn""t shake him off; no matter how enraged I was, Morgan was still physically stronger then me. So, with the ability to storm off gone, I took the first route to vent my feelings I saw. Because of that, pain wracked through my hand as it came into contact with the wall. ""Jesus Christ, Reid!"" Morgan swore as I collapsed into a heap on the ground, my left hand falling limp at my side. Broken; maybe. Sprained; possibly. Bruised? I would be feeling it for a while. Suddenly the others had me surrounded, all speaking at once to see if I was alright. I just sat there, looking numbly at my hand, still feeling all those emotions swirl around inside my body. More manageable, yes; gone, no. ""Reid, are you okay?"" Emily asked from my left. I just nodded silently, still staring down at my hand. Morgan released his death grip on my other hand and leaned back a bit more, ""Didn""t think you had that kinda reaction in you, Reid. Wouldn""t be the first time you""ve surprised the hell outta me, but still..."" ""Sorry..."" I grimaced as I stood, flexing my fingers. They weren""t broken or sprained; I wouldn""t really be able to move them otherwise. Might have bruised the bone though. ""Let""s have that hand looked at, Spence,"" J.J. smiled brightly, but somewhat wearily. Apparently my outburst had surprised them enough to overshadow what Garcia had told us.",748687
1070,"""I am the Duchess of Mandalore and I serve my people. If you wish my death, so be it; I""m yours."" For the first time, her gaze dropped from the man""s face, and her head bowed slightly, as much as the knife would allow. ""But death only brings more death. Mandalore will never be allowed to heal as long as we meet each other with violence."" She looked up at the man once more. ""Make your choice."" Frantically, Obi-Wan, reached out to feel the man""s emotions, to get some sense of what he would do, but all the padawan found was a fierce storm of inner turmoil. No one moved-the entire crowd seemed to hold its breath. The man""s hand began to shake. Still nothing. Seconds dragged into minutes. Satine refused to blink-her eyes never left the man""s. ""Oh, for Force""s sake, Dreig""r, drop the knife!"" The tension was shattered by a voice in the crowd. A familiar voice. Obi-Wan looked up and saw the old woman who had sold them supplies pushing her way through the throng of people. In a moment, she had reached the man (Dreig""r, Obi-wan supposed), and jerked the short blade out of his hand. ""If there is more death, it won""t be at our hands. Here you go, dear."" She handed the knife back to Satine, who gripped it loosely, staring at the old woman in confusion. The woman patted the Duchess""s cheek lightly. ""No need to look so surprised, dear."" She leaned in and whispered in Satine""s ear, ""Ke barjurir gar""ade, jagyc""ade kot""la a dalyc""ade kotla""shya,"" and gave her a conspiratorial wink. Satine snorted, her free hand flying up to cover her mouth. ""Gar serim,"" she responded quietly. ""Take your Jetii and go in peace. We will not reveal your location to those who hunt you."" She paused. ""Isn""t that right, Dreig""r?"" she added, elbowing the man playfully in the ribs. Dreig""r bowed his head and mumbled something incomprehensible. ""What was that?"" the old woman asked. Grudgingly, the man looked up. ""You need not fear us, Duchess."" He ground out the words. Satine grabbed his hand. ""Vor entye. Thank you."" He looked surprised, but nodded his acknowledgement. The crowd parted, and Obi-Wan and Satine quickly made their way to the gate. Right before they exited, Satine turned back to the crowd. ""Ret""urcye mhi."" The old woman nodded her head. ""Ret""urcye mhi, Duchess. Be safe."" With that, she Obi-Wan ducked out of the town and headed back into the deserts of Mandalore. ""This is yours, I believe,"" Satine said, coming to sit beside Obi-Wan on a large boulder. The sun was just beginning to creep over the horizon. The first few rays of dawn colored the night sky. After they had returned to camp and related the what had happened to Qui Gon, the Jedi master had decided it best for them to leave immediately, regardless of the villagers"" promise. They had traveled most of the night, finally stopping on a rocky hillock a number of miles to the east of the town in order to get some rest. Obi-Wan looked down and saw his knife proffered in the Duchess""s hand. ""You should still be sleeping,"" he said. They had stopped barely three hours previously. ""So should you,"" she pointed out, smiling.",2943978
1120,"A few oompa loompas had tested it, and they always would swell up and take on a deep bluish-purple hue. ""I have those children coming tomorrow."" Willy said, sounding more concerned than he meant. Anastasia understood. Willy had gotten his hair trimmed yesterday and the haircutter had found another gray hair. ""Don""t worry. You""ll find someone."" Anastasia said, putting her arms around him. Willy""s stomach jumped. His heart began to pound. Ever so carefully, as though Anastasia was made of glass, he wrapped his arms around her and rested his cheek against her hair. She felt so warm and solid in his arms. It was a feeling he couldn""t ever remember having before. Willy wasn""t used to being touched or hugged or anything, so it was quite strange to him. The next morning, Willy dressed himself up. He didn""t eat any breakfast-his stomach had too many butterflies. Anastasia, however, was as calm and collected as ever. She had put on her red dress, the one with long sleeves and a short skirt. She had on white tights, black Mary-jane shoes, and a black beret over her long blonde hair. ""So, are you ready for this?"" she asked. Willy tried to talk, but nothing came out. She gave him a kiss on the cheek. Willy blushed rather red. He suddenly became dizzy and started to tingle all over. ""Well, it""s time. Let""s go."" Anastasia said, taking his hand. Willy and Anastasia went outside. The gate opened for the five children who had won the golden tickets and their parents. Cameras flashed everywhere and microphones were jammed everywhere to catch a piece of the action. ""I love your chocolate,"" a boy named Augustus said. ""I can see that,"" Willy said, eyeing the boy""s impressive gut. Anastasia didn""t see how he could possibly walk. A little girl ran up to Willy and gave him a big hug. WIlly cringed, clearly unfamiliar with a child""s touch. ""I""m Violet Beauregard."" she said affectionately. Willy was as rigid as a stone. ""I don""t care."" he said with a strange expression on his face. Anastasia was attempting to stifle a giggle. Apparently, she was the only one who could touch him. The day was absolutely crazy. Once inside, the children seemed to be disapearing right and left because they were being greedy. The first one out was Augustus. They were in the chocolate room when Augustus started trying to drink out of the chocolate river. Willy became a little upset and started asking him to leave it alone when Augustus fell in. Everyone else became quite worried. ""The suction""s got him."" Willy said, disgusted at the idea of a very fat boy swimming in his chocolate. ""Please take Mrs. Goop to the fudge room."" he told an oompa loompa. ""I""ll go check on him. I""ll get back here as soon as I can."" Anastasia said, patting him on the shoulder. She and the oompa loompas rushed to the fudge room where Augustus was plugging up one of the pipes. Anastasia pulled a hairclip out of her hair that held back her stray bangs and unscrewed part of the pipe. ""Take my hands."" Anastasia told him. She had put on an apron to keep the chocolate from getting her. He did.",870118
822,"""I want to hunt, but every time I let lose the monster it never ends well,"" he bit down on his lower lip. ""Every time I try it, it""s better than sex and the price is the turning of my hopes and dreams to ash."" He gazed soulfully at his dearest friend. ""Nothing is better than the high that comes from the crusnik killing spree and nothing is worse than the low where I realize that I""m not in control of my actions; the drug takes command of me and I""m just a puppet."" ""More than anything,"" he seethed, ""I want to find that fucking animal Bradley and feet his living eyeballs to the fucking rats!"" Abel then deflated in defeat, ""And more than anything, I""m terrified that there is no moral difference between myself and Bradley."" Caterina nodded. She paused to weigh her words before speaking to Abel. ""Do you honestly hold yourself as being the same as a child killer,"" sounded incredulous instead of sympathetic. She laughed just a little bit, ""Abel, wake the fuck up."" The sound of a swear word from the Duchess of Milan""s mouth startled Abel even though her laugh caused him to feel anger towards his confidant. ""Abel, you have problems. If this has burned you out, I understand; the magnitude of this evil is monstrous but you are not the only one,"" her voice took a hard tone, like a mother telling her child to stop pitying himself. ""I can personally attest to having done things I""m not proud of myself, Abel,"" Caterina continued, ""Unfortunately none of us can forget our sins and perhaps it is too much to hope for forgiveness."" Caterina stood up and looked down at Abel, putting her hands on his shoulders. ""Abel, you can be whatever you want to be and nothing I or anyone else can do a thing to stop you."" ""Just stop pitying yourself!"" she hissed at Abel. ""You know that I will be there to help you until the day one of us is dead."" ""What you saw was monstrous, Abel,"" Caterina continued, ""That such things actually happen is proof that devils walk among us even if you do not believe in god."" She spoke, and as she spoke she was at her most vulnerable, ""Abel,"" she spoke barely above a whisper, a single tear fell down her cheek, ""Let us help you Abel, please; I cannot imagine what you are going through but please, just let me help. Don""t do this to yourself."" Abel stared up into Caterina""s face, his finger rubbing finally stopped. Immediately, Abel felt heat rise to his face and an uncomfortable sweat came over him. At last he could help it no longer; Abel lunged forward and hugged Caterina like she was going to vanish before his eyes. She would die, they would all die; Esther, Caterina, the Professor. Even Tres Inques the android would fall to pieces and rust before Abel would die. Immortality was a curse; it was also the ultimate form of revenge. Abel went through life, everything he saw dying before his eyes like mayflies. Though he loved fiercely, the burn of loss never listened. To others though, like his twisted late brother; immortality was the ideal form of revenge. Cane never cared about the changing world, for he had no earthly attachment to anyone or thing.",1220273

Daniel flew above Fi causing her to duck. ""How could you do that for me? Your ancestors not only humiliated me they caused me to lose my own life at an early age.

Clu, Carey and Annie looked at each other in shock that he believed what Annie had said. ""Help me! Jack!"" Jack turned his flashlight back on running through the rooms following Fi""s voice. Carey leaned down and saw a blue print. Carey stretched the blue print out and pointed to the east. ""She""s in the living room... over here"" Jack, Clu, Carey and Annie ran into the living room and felt cold air surround them. ""He""s here"" The wind blew Jack back. ""Carey!"" Fi ran up to Carey.

179,"A sound comparable to a sonic boom could be heard throughout the outside hallway as Flagarance made contact with Bossun""s face, knocking off his Poppaman hat and sending it flying to the other side of the room. Shaking in pain as reached out to touch the huge red mark now stretching down from his forehead to his lips, Bossun could only look up from his kneeling position as tears of pain stained his face. ""What the HELL was that for?"" he screamed loudly. Himeko just gave him her piercing Yankee gaze, with Flagarance still poised to strike just above his head. Bossun couldn""t see it, but there was just a slight tinge of pink present on her face. She looked away, crossing her arms before giving him an almost quiet response. ""You""re just so annoying sometimes that I can""t help myself, leader."" There was a strange feeling in the air. It was something that Switch couldn""t really put his finger on, and it would be the death of him if he decided to admit that it was something of spiritual origin. He looked back at the old incinerator behind him with blank eyes. To think that such a relic could contain so-called spirits was ridiculous. But then again, so were some of his recent actions. Switch turned back around, and continued to wait with his computer situated perfectly on his lap. All in all, the last three days had been pretty ridiculous in general. Switch was absolutely sure of that. In the distance, he could see her approaching. Her long raven hair covered part of her face, and she walked with her arms outstretched. Her back was hunched over, and she looked like a zombie as she made her way next to Switch and sat down. The cold cement between the two felt like some sort of barrier, especially considering how silent Yuuki was. Switch""s head pivoted like a submarine periscope. He stared at Yuuki as he typed his words out quickly. Despite the giddy emotion he was trying to convey, his words were becoming very quiet and distorted. [So I see you got my memo. Bravo, Yuuki-san!] His attempt to lift the mood didn""t seem to affect Yuuki very much. Her response was quiet and more dead than usual, even for her. ""Shimada-san told me you wanted to see me here after school. So I came."" [I can see that.] Switch said with a laugh in his synthesized voice. [I must say that you look more beautifully dreadful than usual.] When his typing stopped, Yuuki turned to look at him, and then glanced at his computer. His synthesized voice was becoming so low that she could barely hear what he was saying. It was as if each passing sentence of his was becoming quieter than the last. ""Your computer..."" she said, her tone becoming suddenly grave. ""...I see that the curse has its final hold on you. I feel sorry for you, Switch-kun, but I am also disappointed. I expected more from someone like you..."" Then the occult girl laughed, her eyes glowing with ghastly excitement. ""It""s so strange. You""re finally on the edge of my world, yet something feels so wrong..."" [I am not surprised you feel that way.] Switch declared, before he stood up and suddenly became very intimidating.",967934
3285,"he raised the baton again and she raised her bow, he took a deep breath, getting ready to sing ""Se ben rammentomi"", again. Celeste dropped her arm and declared, ""It just makes me want to scream!"" Erik fell forward, put his elbows on the table, his head in his hands, and sigh with exasperation. ""I know, I know. I""m sorry,"" Celeste said, positioning her violin and bow again, ""Here, I""m ready to play now."" ""Forget it,"" Erik said, standing up and pacing, ""You""re of no mind to play tonight. If you let these morons get away with distracting you then you should burn that thing, and leave now, for they will have won."" ""I""m not quitting because a peacock and a pig think I""m a talking turd,"" Celeste said. ""Language, Madam,"" Erik said. He hated that she still spoke that way, even if it was only in private. ""Or have those lessons been for nothing, as well?"" ""To Hell with your lessons!"" Celeste shouted. She leaped up and stomped to her bed and threw herself on it. Erik sighed again and walked to his own rooms. He went to a table and poured himself a glass of cognac and downed it in a gulp. He set that down, hung his head a moment. What was he going to do with this girl? Christine was never this way. When La Carlotta had insulted Christine, the girl would often cry, but never speak like a drunk in a pub. He shook his head. He would not think of Christine. She wasn""t his student, now, Celeste was. And like it or not, Celeste""s tongue was harsh and sometimes vulgar because of her life on the streets. He could live with it. He straightened his shirt and returned quietly to give his pupil one more chance, but as he opened the door, he saw her turned to the window, but she wasn""t looking at it. She was looking at something in her hand. As Erik took another step, the floor creaked, and Celeste, looking like a child caught sneaking a taste of cake, hurried and put whatever she had been looking at back in the drawer of her bedside table. ""What do you want,"" she asked, raking a hand through her long tresses. ""I had thought to give practice one more try,"" he replied, walking to the edge of her bed. ""I can""t concentrate,"" she said, shaking her head. Erik""s eyes looked from her to the drawer, then he asked, ""Perhaps we can talk, then. A light conversation?"" She looked up at him, her eyes saying, ""You must be joking,' but she didn""t say that. Instead she said, ""I""m tired. I""d prefer to go to bed."" ""Then good night,"" Erik said, walking out. However, he did not go to bed just then. Instead he waited until Celeste was asleep. Then, without stepping in the creaking spot, he snuck into her room. He crept to her bedside, and slowly opened the drawer. Years of subterranean life had helped to make his eyes see better in the dark than anyone else. He reached in and took out the one object in the drawer. A tiny picture, framed in a simple wood oval. It was no photograph, but a painting. In it was a young Japanese girl, with her face painted white, though her very dainty hands were golden, and her black hair bound up behind her head.",512464
3566,"It""s better than anyone else would have been able to do, Effie."" Their drinks arrived. Haymitch had figured that Effie was a fruity drink kind of girl who would refuse the scotch, conveniently leaving him a second one. But she surprised him, taking a long drink of it. ""You never answered my question."" He took his own drink. ""I""ll need at least a bottle in me before I can do that conversation. So sit and drink with me."" She did. He nodded at her drink. ""Never pegged you for a scotch drinker."" Effie was rolling the dark liquid in her glass, watching the ice shift. ""My father drank scotch. He used to give me sips of it when I was a little girl."" She took another long drink. They fell back into a silence. It was a strange experience for both of them, they had gotten used to bickering and words always came easily to them when they argued. The silence continued until they refilled their drinks. Haymitch silently asked if she wanted another and she slid her glass to him nodding. Effie broke it, ""Is this your first time in the Capitol? I mean besides the Games obviously."" She didn""t wait for him to answer. ""I could have given you a tour, I guess. There""s this delightful little shop that sells..."" And off she went. Haymitch tuned her out, focusing on his drinking instead. He had finished a bottle when she said something that broke through and he interrupted her, ""Do you even listen to your own prattling?"" She blinked, unsure of what he meant, ""What do you mean? I certainly never..."" Before she could take off again, Haymitch said, ""Shut up, Effie."" ""Why do you say that? To me? To the woman who came before me?"" So she was back on this. ""Why do you care?"" ""How can you not? You""re part of the most wondrous event..."" ""I""m going to stop you right there. There""s nothing wonderful about children in an all-out death match."" Effie bit her tongue for a while, but after a few more drinks she couldn""t help herself, ""My father loved the games you know. We always used to watch them as a family. He used to work so much that I hardly ever got to see him, except when the Games came around and President Snow didn""t need him."" That did interest Haymitch. Effie""s father worked for Snow? ""What does your father do for Snow?"" ""Oh,"" Effie looked flustered, like she hadn""t meant to say that out loud, ""My father died a few years ago, but he used to be in charge of District Relations."" This was all very interesting to Haymitch. ""Really? And how did he die?"" Effie""s eyes took a sad turn, ""There was a train accident."" Haymitch wondered if it had been an accident, being close to Snow and the districts sounded like a job with a low life expectancy to him. Effie snapped out of her sad state quickly though, ""What about your parents, Haymitch?"" He sighed, bored again, ""What about them?"" ""What did they do?"" She knew from her research that they had both passed away when he was younger. ""Dad died in a mining accident."" He took a drink. He wouldn""t talk about his mother, not with this woman. ""And your mother?"" She pressed. ""None of your damn business, Effie.""",1497577
2656,"I looked around, and when I was convinced that I was alone, I stepped closer to the memorial and started talking. ""Hello, guys,"" I said in a low voice. ""It""s been a while since I visited you the last time. As a matter of fact, I haven""t been here since this time last year. And so much has happened since then... I don""t even know where to start. I live in Chicago now. Life hasn""t been easy since we lost you, you know. I miss my task, and I even miss you bossing me about. After all, we had some fun, didn""t we? ""I""ve got some serious problem going on with Yves. You may not believe it, but I saw her again. I told you we""d lost the contact, didn""t I? Well, anyway, we met again in a club a few months ago. And what can I say... it was as if we""d never parted. There was still something going on between us, if you know what I mean. And I didn""t make pretending or something, I tell you! There was something. But Yves was pretty drunk, and so I don""t know whether she even remembers what she did. She kissed me, you know. She just kissed me, and then she disappeared into the crowd. No explanation, no further conversation, nada! And now I don""t know what to make of all the fuss. Shall I call her again and insist that she explain it to me? Or shall I just sit back and wait until she does something? You know, women... It""s so difficult to understand what they want; sometimes I doubt that they know themselves. (I reckon I""m not the first man on earth to reach this conclusion.) ""Guys, help me! I""ve got the feeling that Yves is avoiding me, and I don""t know why. Maybe she""s embarrassed. Or she waits for me to take the first step. Or she can""t remember a thing. But I need to do something, or otherwise I""ll go mad! I tell you, the next time I see her I won""t let her shrug off the matter like some unpleasant problem she wants to deal with later. Next time I""ll just..."" I trailed off. What, actually, was I going to do? It was easy to make plans right now, but what would I do when she was actually standing in front of me? Knowing myself, I reckoned I""d lose courage and just talk for hours without really saying anything. I made a resolution. I decided to me a man. I decided not to lose courage. I decided to show Yves that my love for her was real. It wasn""t just some blaze that faded after the first night or something. I would love her all my life. If she let me. ""Guys,"" I said silently, ""I swear to you here on your graves: I won""t give up. Not this time. I won""t let her go again. She slipped from me, but this will not happen again. And if you have any means to help me - this is the moment! You see, I need all the help I can get."" I remained silent for a moment. I had gotten so emotional that I almost expected a sign from the guys. There was nothing, of course, only the soft rustling of the leaves and the almost inaudible whispering of the grass. ""Mind me sitting down for a sec?"" I asked the memorial. I sat down in front of the white stone memorial and instantly sank into thoughts.",240213
2963,"""Nephilim..."" I choked out. My throat felt tight as I made my way to her side. My vision blurred slightly as I stared down at her. Just stared. It had been thirteen years since I last saw her, a little girl of ten years old. Now here she was, nearly twenty-four years old... and she hadn""t changed a bit. Even that innocent gleam in her eyes was still there. How? She reached out her hands and grabbed mine, pulling me forward with all the force of a pesky fly. I didn""t need her to tell me what she wanted; in an instant I pulled her into a hug, burying my head in her shoulder. I could feel tears spill over as I held to her my chest. She giggled - something I never thought I would hear again - and wrapped her arms around me as I held her as tightly as I could. In truth, I was afraid she would disappear, that she would vanish and I would wake up in my apartment at Quantico. Even now I could scarcely believe this was real, that it wasn""t a dream. Then the image of that basement came to my mind; this couldn""t be a dream. I held her tighter. ""Reid, let her breathe man,"" Morgan said, his voice laced with amusement. I pulled away from Nephilim but kept my seat on the edge of her bed; she wouldn""t let my hands go. I wiped my face on the shoulder of my shirt quickly. ""They said would come for me,"" Her voice was so earnest, so childlike, that it made my heart ache. She really hadn""t changed... Morgan moved to just behind me. It was time now; time for questioning. Unknowingly I held her hands tighter, looking back at Morgan. He nodded and I turned to Edwards, ""Dr. Edward, may we speak to her alone?"" She nodded, ""I will be in my office if you need me; the call button is right next to the bed and the nurses"" station is just outside."" Once she was gone, I looked back down at Nephilim. ""Nephi,"" I used her old nickname, hoping to keep her calm, ""Who said I would come?"" ""The... the Oracle and the girl who looked after me,"" She said quietly, looking down at our hands, ""He said that he needed to make sure you came here to find me."" This threw me a bit, ""Why me?"" To both Morgan""s and my surprise, an unmistakable bright pink blush made its way across her ghostly pale features. She managed to pull her hands out of mine and wrapped them around her knees, which she pulled up to her chest. I turned to look at Morgan, who shrugged. With a sigh, I ducked down so I was eye level with her. ""Nephi, why did they need me to find you?"" I made sure to speak slowly and as nonthreateningly as I could. At first she wouldn""t look me in the eye, but after a moment, Nephilim turned back towards me. ""They said I can""t tell you anything or you will leave..."" My eyebrows shot up for a moment before a light chuckle escaped me, ""I""m right here, aren""t I? It""ll be okay."" ""I... I guess so..."" Her eyes kept shooting in Morgan""s direction. She fell silent, looking between him and I until she added, ""Wh-who""s he?"" Morgan smiled reassuringly, ""I""m Supervisory Special Agent Derek Morgan with the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI; Spencer here is my partner.""",748687
1738,"He chuckled, ""Better clothes and accommodations at the very least."" ""Milord, I... I am sorry, but..."" My gaze dropped to Mother""s headstone. It would be a lie to say it wasn""t tempting, but... Leaving the farm would mean leaving her. Leaving the little shack by the desert woods, leaving behind the Eddars who had been so kind to us both... Tyrion followed my gaze and must have guessed my thoughts, for he clicked his tongue and said, ""I would pay the Eddars to clean and upkeep the grave and your little shack here. I would ask for a carriage from Lord Allyrion as well, since I doubt you would be comfortable riding for a month on horseback."" He eyed me, eyebrow raised, ""Have you ever ridden a horse?"" ""No, milord."" ""I suppose you could call me Father now, as well,"" The comment was flippant, but upon seeing the horror on my face he quickly added, ""Or not. But the ""milord"" business makes me a mite uncomfortable, coming from Tysha""s child. At least call me Tyrion."" ""Thank you, um... T-Tyrion,"" It felt weird to say, but at least it was better than ""Father"". ""Well, that settles it. Would you prefer to stay here before you and I leave in a week, or come with me back to Lord Allyrion""s castle?"" Tyrion smiled and walked around me, now between me and the dirt path to the farmhouse. ""I... I would stay here until then,"" Castles and Lords and all the extravagance that would bring was... frightening. Even the golden fist emblem of the Hand adorning Tyrion""s shirt was probably worth more than the whole tiny farm put together. And I needed some time to think. Tyrion only shrugged, ""That is fine. I""ll return each day to talk and get to know my bastard. Until then."" Then, with nothing more than an inclination of the head and a final look at my mother""s grave, Tyrion Lannister turned on his heel and walked with purpose back to the Eddars""s home. It took me a full five minutes to realize that I""d just been played. Technically, I""d never said I would go. But now I was in a bind. He""s weaseled a sort-of agreement out of me without me even realizing it. And now, I would be off for King""s Landing in a week""s time. Author""s Note: I had so much fun writing this chapter. I technically included stuff from the books, with the insinuation that Tyrion was forced to participate in Tysha""s assault and forced to pay with a gold coin, since that wasn""t stated in the show, but whatever. Also, it took math to figure out how old Synne should be, since in the books the whole thing with Tyrion and Tysha happened when he was thirteen whereas in the show he was sixteen (since most got aged up it seems). Oh well. Still had a lot of fun writing this. Yay, stories! And Jon will appear eventually, as well most of the cast I let survive, no worries. This is written before the series end, so when the last season or book comes out, some may be alive that weren""t in the book/show or visa versa, but whatever. My fanfic, my rules. Chapter Two King""s Landing ""For last year""s words belong to last year""s language/ And next year""s words await another voice./ And to make an end is to make a beginning.""",748687
67,"I asked. When she nodded slowly, I knew. We were dealing with a man with multiple personality disorder that also fit the characteristics that she had given us. He had religious personalities too... Just like Tobias. I shuddered and closed my eyes. Images came to my mind in perfect clarity; tied to a chair and ordered to choose one of my friends to die, digging my own grave... the pinch of a cool needle sliding under my skin, giving a momentary relief from the pain. ""Reid?"" Morgan said slowly, reaching across the bed to grab my shoulder, ""Reid?"" My eyes snapped open and I sprang up off the bed and started to pace. The unmistakable rising in Nephilim""s heart rate reached my ears as the machine monitoring her vitals began to go haywire. ""Is he okay?"" She said, her soft voice getting higher again, ""Spence, Spence, did I say something wrong? I... I""m sorry..."" All I could do was shake my head, ""No, you didn""t do anything wrong, Nephilim. Nothing that happened is your fault, okay?"" I turned back towards her and forced a smile as I sat back down again, ""Now, Nephi... is there anything else?"" ""Anything else?"" Morgan took over for me, ""Anything he said that seemed odd, what he did, how he treated you, anything you can think of?"" ""Mr. Reynolds was nice,"" She said, ""The only time I was ever hurt by him or anyone else was after the babies were born. He kept me in a room with video games and lots of dolls. Ellie, the nurse, usually took care of me. She came about two years ago; the Oracle took her too. He said that no one else was supposed to see me anymore and he needed someone to take care of me when he couldn""t. Th-then... when a baby was born, he took it away and I never even saw them. He gave me a week and then Set took over... he is the mean one. He... he hurts me..."" Her voice got higher and Nephilim""s face screwed up in pain, ""He... he t-t-touched me... and... and he... p-put stuff in me... over and over and over again... and... and he cut me and... and it didn""t stop... it didn""t stop until the... the little test strips said ""pregnant"" or turned blue. He... he hurt me... so much... th-then he locked me in my room with Ellie, and she would help me get better."" She buried her head in her knees and sobbed, pulling her sheets tighter around her. The machine next to the bed sputtered and sped up. I was at a loss for what to do. Slowly, as if any sudden movement would make her completely break down, I reached out and drew her into another hug. Nephilim curled up into a ball and just cried, gripping my shirt with all the strength that her weak arms could muster. I looked up at the ceiling felt my eyes water. I rested my chin on top of her head as I held her. How could anyone do this to another human being? Thirteen years of torture and abuse... ""The... the only ones... wh-who were nice... were... Mr. Reynolds an-and Ellie..."" She choked out, gripping my shirt tighter. Nephilim gasped and looked up at me, ""Wh-what if he... wh-what if he hurts Ellie?!",748687
2718,"It""s pretty smart that you""re floating above the crowd and- holy crap!"" Saitama was caught by surprise when the green-haired esper suddenly gathered the floating groceries and gently placed them in his cart. She floated down to where the bald hero was, as Genos squeezed his way through to regroup with his teacher. ""Sensei, is that all of it?"" he asked. ""A box of kelp... some onions... and yep. That""s all of it. Thanks, Tats."" Saitama said with a thumbs up. Tatsumaki crossed her arms as she let out a huff. ""Just hurry up and pay for those. I need to talk to you about something."" she said before walking out of the supermarket. Saitama watched her leave, curious on what she""s going to tell him. The two heroes then went to the counter to pay for the groceries before exiting the supermarket. ""What""s up?"" Saitama asked the esper, who in return glanced up at him. ""It""s... a bit personal."" she muttered as she transferred her gaze back to the ground. ""Oh."" Saitama muttered as he glanced at Genos. ""Hey, is it alright if you bring these back to my apartment?"" he said, giving the cyborg an apologetic look. ""Of course, sensei! It""s the least I could do!"" ""Thanks, dude."" ""It""s not a problem."" Genos replied as he grabbed the plastic bags and jumped up at a nearest building and then running at top speed. Tatsumaki then started to walk away, not even informing the bald hero. ""Hey!"" Saitama called out as he walked behind her. Ever since Tatsumaki and Fubuki""s argument yesterday, the small esper has been oddly quiet. Saitama was still getting used to this side of hers. ""I still don""t get what Fubuki was getting all fired up about. Yeah sure, I consider having friends now but compared her so-called ""friends"", they are just a bunch of pathetic freaks who could potentially weaken her."" Tatsumaki said, her pace of talking a tad bid too fast. Saitama looked down at her, thinking of what to say. He didn""t really wanted to get involved with their fight. ""You don""t measure friendship based on their powers, Tatsumaki."" he said as he placed his hands in his hoodies"" pockets. ""It""s just like Fubuki said, having a friend is like having family. You accept them as who they are because they""ll be the only ones who""d be there for you when you really need it."" Tatsumaki scoffed. The mere idea of what Saitama said sounded downright ridiculous to her. ""Then why did my parents give me up when I needed them most?"" she said as painful memories started to pour in again. She hated thinking about it. Saitama scratched the back of his head. Indeed, what Tatsumaki went through as a kid was hell, since the ones she trusted the most would suddenly leave her like that. He might not be able to convince her to change her mind, but he had to try. ""Look, Tats, your parents weren""t the best parents and that""s all in the past. Sure, they gave you up to a bunch of strangers, but that doesn""t say who you are today. Forget about them, and find a family of your own that would treat you what you deserve."" Saitama said as Tatsumaki could only stare at the ground. As usual, the bald hero had a point.",2750536

Just look over your shoulder Just look over your shoulder Just look over your shoulder He then slows down on the piano and ends it on a tender crescendo, leaving one piano key tone sustained and the blue spotlight silently dimmed, leaving a somber silhouette of Johnny on the center and everyone in the audience just stood up cheering and applauding as the lights were brought back on as he stood up.

He""s looking at you...intently,"" Nuriko continued to tease Chidori. Nuriko was right. Out of the corner of Chidori""s eye, she saw that Hotohori was indeed looking at her. Her heart started to beat fast. ""You do make a cute couple..."" Nuriko said thoughtfully. ""Of course not!"" Chidori defended herself again. ""Really???"" ""Um..well...he""s good-looking, cute, kind and has that nice smile on his face...BUT were only friends!"" Chidori twirled her chopsticks. ""Aw! Say that again...after you are married,"" Nuriko giggled as she watched Chidori blush even more. ""We""re just friends!!!"" Everyone became silent as Chidori shouted, ""Ah...it""s nothing!!! hahaha!"" she covered Nuriko""s mouth when the latter attempted to say something. They continued what they were doing as Chidori sighed. She looked around and noticed something. ""Where is Tasuki?"" she asked the still laughing Nuriko. ""Not here. He is so stubborn, you know!"" Nuriko answered after regaining her composure. ""Because of me..."" Chidori whispered. ""AHHHHH!!!"" Suddenly, a figure fell down from the tree and landed flat on the ground. ""Omigosh! Is he still alive?! Help!! Call someone! Police! Doctor! Nurse! Any one!!"" Miaka panicked because the figure landed beside her. ""Tasuki? Are you alright?"" Tamahome approached the figure. ""Tasuki?"" the others also approached him. ""Ouch!"" Tasuki stirred and tried to get up but failed. ""We need to bring you to the hospital. I""ll call the ambulance,"" Mitsukake ran to the nearest phone booth. ""You have a wound!"" Chidori noticed a small cut in his arm. ""That""s nothing,"" Tasuki said as he snatched his arm from Chidori. ""Don""t be so stubborn!"" Chidori shouted. Tasuki just stared at her. She got her handkerchief and wrapped it in his wound. ""Tha...thank you..."" Chidori smiled as she heard Tasuki whisper those words. ""You broke about 3 bones in your ribs..."" Mitsukake concluded. He just finished calling, ""The ambulance will be here in a short while."" ----------------------- ""Yuuhi! Have you found her?"" Aya greeted a very exhausted Yuuhi. He was a total wreck. ""No,"" he answered. ""I""ll go and find her again after I check Shota.,"" he walked towards Shota""s room when... ""Ouch!...Ah!"" Yuuhi spun around to see Aya clutching her belly. ""Aya! What""s wrong? Help!"" Yuuhi ran towards Aya and supported her. Suzumi, Q-chan and Aki arrived. Toya still hasn""t come back from finding Chidori. ""I...I...think I""ll...Ouch!"" Aya shouted in pain. ""Q-chan! The car! Aki! Call Toya! Quick!"" Suzumi instructed as she help Yuuhi support Aya. ""Aya, you""ll be alright. Don""t worry,"" Suzumi whispered as they went inside the car.------------------------------- ""Good thing it wasn""t that serious,"" Chichiri noted as Nuriko told them Tasuki""s condition.

649,"""I""m Billy..."" ""and I""m his cousin Mary,"" Mary interrupted with flirty little smile. Oh great the kid had a crush on him already. ""Nice to meet you,"" he said shaking hands with both of them. ""Shay have you seen my nail polish,"" Wendy said coming in through the doorway to the kitchen, but froze the moment she saw the stranger sitting at the kitchen table. The moment he turned to look at her, she got that whole dreamy look on her face. How I knew that look was because I had once worn it as well. ""Hi, I""m Wendy,"" Wendy said quickly extending her hand to him. Diego shook it without returning any of the same emotion Wendy was feeling toward him. Instead he turned back to me. ""I was going to see if you""d like to come with me back down to Maryland for a little while. I mean I know it""ll be better than hanging out here in boring old Connecticut,"" Diego suggested before continuing, ""Besides they got way better doctors than they do up here."" ""I think she""s perfectly fine here,"" Matt bit out quickly before I could reply. ""All the same I would like to hear her answer,"" Diego said forcing a smile. Looking between the two men, Wendy quickly noticed my situation. ""Hey, Shay can you come help me look for my nail polish,"" without so much as a look between them I jumped up and headed on into the living with her. ""Okay, what""s going on? Who""s he, and why in the hell is he giving you those looks,"" Wendy hissed under her breath at me. ""He""s my ex, and a really good friend of mine now actually,"" I told her and she immediately assessed the situation finally before turning to look at me. ""So that""s why the two boys are in there glaring each other down,"" Wendy chuckled. I nodded before she quickly asked with a giggle, ""He still loves you don""t he."" I nodded and she squealed, ""I knew it."" ""I""m with Matt,"" I hissed at her. ""Yeah, but I love the drama. It""s just like my romance novel,"" Wendy smiled. ""Don""t go comparing my life to one of your books,"" I glared playfully at her before turning back to look at the kitchen. ""We better get back in there before one of them kills one another,"" I replied, as she nodded in agreement. Returning to the kitchen we made sure to keep the two boys apart, for the next 3 hours before Diego had to leave. Wendy some how managed to keep Diego interested in her as I sat in Matt""s lap watching him. It seemed like Diego had finally warmed up to Wendy as he slid her his number when he thought I wasn""t looking. Yeah, whatever we once had was over. We both were trying to move on now. Finally thought it came time fore him to leave. Walking him out to his car he turned to me, ""I really wish you""d come with me. I miss you a lot, and it wouldn""t be that bad where I""m staying at. There are a lot of parties and 18 year old clubs. Just a bunch of stuff I know you""d enjoy going to."" Looking back at the house he stared for a long time before looking back down at me and saying, ""Do you really like him that much."" I simply nodded and answered, ""He""s a good guy. A little troubled with the cancer and all, but all the same a good guy."" ""He doesn""t deserve you.",806976
3256,"Face it the world relies on technology"" Carey rubbed his eyes sighing... no use trying to talk her out of it. ""What are we searching for?"" Carey looked at the computer screen. ""Unexplainable phenomena"" ""Well no duh... that""s your area. I meant what are we looking for exactly?"" ""Well... I don""t quite know yet. I don""t know a lot about what is going on but I do know that something is definitely up. Carey you said you felt someone""s cold hands pick you up and throw you across the room but there was no one in the room... or at least we couldn""t see them. I was looking down at your arm and all of a sudden goosebumps appear on your arm"" ""Ooh goosebumps! Goosebumps appearing on my arm don""t mean that there is some sort of spirit attacking us"" Fi looked at Carey and smiled wide. ""What? What did I say? My big mouth"" Fi clicked away on her computer biting on her bottom lip scanning the page with her eyes. ""Spirits. That little boy that came up to you and Clu earlier today said that this place was haunted right? Well what if some sort of spirit lives here and attacks whoever enters his or hers home without permission?"" Carey looked at the screen. ""So let""s just say this place is haunted by a evil doing revenge seeking spirit what does house rentals have anything to do with it?"" Fi looked at Carey and smiled... Carey knew that something was ticking in Fi""s mind... he was just afraid of how much trouble she was getting them in to. ""I""m looking for who lived here last... or someone who lived here and moved out under weird circumstances. Maybe something happened and this spirit or ghost hasn""t gotten over it. See if a person died before their time or if something horrible happened to them their spirit may live on to try to right the wrong that happened and sometimes they never right that wrong so they live forever tormenting people"" Carey sighed lying on the floor... there was no way he was gonna believe that some spirit was attacking them for a reason... it was just psychically impossible. Wasn""t it? He did feel something pick him up but it could have just been his imagination... right? A vision of all the weird things he encountered flew through his mind. The siren he fell in love with... the werewolf that later turned out to be a little girl... the way that song came into his mind... the oopa... the poltergeist... the emails that were sent to Fi... Katherine in Annie""s body.... Bricriu... The Nexus. Fi stopped scanning search results when she found the website she was looking for. ""The history of the McMann house and Daniel McMann"" Fi finished scanning the site and saved the documents on the page such as pictures, sounds, and word documents on disk and printed out a word document and closed her computer. ""Technology is the best"" Fi smiled and walked over to Carey and pushed him out of whatever dreamland he was in. Carey looked up to see Fi smiling at him... her smile was mischievous. She had found something, which made him curious. He smiled himself... he had to give kudos to Fi... no matter what she was looking for she found it. ""What did you find?""",29783
1118,"Her hair was done up in a bun and her bangs were braided and pinned back. The monster in Willy longed for all that long, curly hair to cascade down her shoulders again. Oh, if he could touch it... Willy snapped back to life when Anastasia got up. ""Do you want to see the rest of the factory?"" he asked. Anastasia nodded. He showed her the chocolate room first. Even though Anastasia had just had breakfast, she couldn""t help but nibble on things. She was fascinated by the chocolate waterfall. ""It""s a kid""s dream! I bet there are kids all over the world who""d give their life just to come in here and cram."" Anastasia said, dipping a candy leaf into the river and taking a bite. The childish innocence on her face as she stood with both hands full of candy, nibbling each one slowly, made Willy smile. A warmth filled his heart like a candleflame. When she had tried at least a lick of everything in the room, they explored the rest of the factory. By the time they were done, Anastasia was clutching her stomach. ""I haven""t eaten like this in years. "" she laughed. Willy allowed himself a secret smile. He hadn""t had this much fun. To believe that another adult could have fun like this was beautiful to him. They had made their way to Anastasia""s room. She stretched out across the bed, listening to Willy talk. Without realizing it, he also sat down on the bed beside her. Little by little, they became quiet. Anastasia eventually fell asleep, and Willy became worn out himself. Ever so carefully, Willy lay down on the bed beside her. He slid over until Anastasia""s head was touching his shoulder. After laying very still for a long time, Anastasia started to roll over. Her head landed on Willy""s chest and one arm flung itself across his stomach. She felt so warm. The monster awakened itself once again, but it was purring. Willy wrapped his arms around her and drifted off to sleep. Upon waking, Willy realized that Anastasia must be awake. He heard splashing coming from the bathroom. The image of Anastasia having a bubble bath made him tremble. Anastasia came out dressed in a pair of black leather flare pants and a white top. Her long blonde hair was braided today. ""Would you like to see the outside world today?"" she asked. Willy didn""t know what to say. ""I""ve seen everything here, so now I want to show you some of my secrets."" Anastasia said, straightening his funny-looking hat. ""First things first, everyone will recognize you in those clothes. You might want to change into something less conspicuous. "" Willy dug through his closet and found a faded pair of blue jeans and a black T-shirt. Anastasia left the room so he could get dressed. Once he had, Anastasia got him by the wrist and hauled him outside. They hadn""t even had breakfast yet. ""All right. First thing you have to know is do what I do. In order to survive in my world, you have to act just like me. The real world isn""t all cozy and colorful like your factory. There are some good people, and there are some real trouble makers. There is one rule: do whatever you have to do to survive. Now, we do this my way.""",870118
1973,"Mira was surprised that the men had mostly refrained from hitting all of the Fairy Tail women, and Jenny Realight wasn""t constantly posing and fighting with her. In fact they were mostly staying at the table with the Thunder Legion and Laxus. Though Mira supposed that shouldn""t surprise her, the group had joined Blue Pegasus when Fairy Tail had disbanded. It made sense that they""d made friends at the other guild. Mira remembered being surprised when she found out that Laxus and his crew had joined that guild, as she (and most people) thought of it as the pretty boy guild. And while she had always found Laxus attractive, she had never thought of him as a pretty boy. Still, the table seemed to be getting along well. Telling stories and laughing like old friends. Mira wasn""t happy to see Jenny seated next to Laxus, but she pushed her jealousy down. It didn""t mean anything. Jenny came up a little later to refill her drink, she started immediately needling Mira, ""Well, how is Fiore""s second prettiest model?"" ""I was just about to ask you that, Jenny."" Mira responded with a smile. She nodded to the empty glass in the frowning model""s hand. ""Can I refresh your drink?"" ""Yeah,"" Jenny handed Mira the glass. Mira began assembling a new drink for her rival. Jenny turned to face the table she""d been sitting at. ""You know, sometimes I miss having Laxus in our guild."" Mira""s hands stopped scooping ice for a moment before she forced herself to keep going. ""I always wondered, how did Laxus end up in your guild anyway?"" Mira hoped her voice didn""t betray her interest. Jenny didn""t act any differently, answering, ""Master wanted a good-looking bad boy in the guild. With his scar, tattoo and reputation, Laxus fit the description perfectly, so we recruited him."" Mira set down the finished drink by Jenny""s elbow, ""It didn""t have to do with the fact he was a powerful S Class Mage?"" ""That didn""t hurt, but no, it was the whole bad boy thing."" She looked over at the lightening dragon slayer. ""You know, I never did get a chance to sleep with him while he was in our guild. Bet he fucks like a stallion."" The smile didn""t leave Mira""s face, but her nails dug into her palms. ""I wouldn""t know."" Jenny grinned, and glanced back at Mira, ""Well, I""ll find out tonight and let you know."" As Jenny walked back to the table, Mira said through clenched teeth, ""Good luck with that."" Laxus wouldn""t sleep with her. Yes, Jenny was beautiful. And yes, they weren""t in any sort of official monogamous relationship, but still, he wouldn""t do that. Right? Right? Mira tried to put it out of her mind, but her eyes kept drifting to where Jenny sat next to Laxus. She laughed too loudly at his jokes and put her hands on his arms, eventually leaving them there, causally wrapped around his bicep. Laxus didn""t seem too interested, which may have comforted Mira if not for the fact that Laxus never looked interested in anyone. Even around her, he always acted cool. It bothered her all night, despite her best efforts. But she managed to keep it together.",1497577
3212,"The storms had gotten so dangerous to the point that they were unable to navigate through them; much like the one we got caught in once,"" I answered, as she hummed at the painful memory she had of it. Then again, it was probably more painful for me to remember her in that state, than it was for her. ""Anyway, when the warriors arrived at Home Tree to negotiate her return home, they found my grandmother already mated to my grandfather and just barely with child. They were furious, and refused to talk with the chief any longer. Returning home they told their leader and head warrior what they had found. It was then that their chief finally declared war upon the Omaticaya for ""kidnapping,' my grandmother. This war, of course, lasted several years, and involved many other clans. It brought about the Thanator Clan""s bitterness towards the others, and eventually led them to become recluse. In the end, the Omaticaya won the war, and in that amount of time my father had already been born. Sadly though, he was left with the stigma as the troublemaker and the cause of this break. Eventually he met my mother, and they became a mated pair. My mother soon became pregnant with me, and later died during the childbirth. I""d been too early from what I""ve been told. My father, grandfather, and grandmother all raised me together. Eventually, my grandfather and grandmother passed away from old age."" ""What about your father? Where is he,"" my wife asked carefully, as she laced her tiny fingers around two of my own. Swallowing the hard lump that had formed in my throat, I pushed away the bitterness that had begun to build itself within my heart. ""My father was killed by the sky people, while trying to protect me. It is one of the reasons why I detested them so much, and still in a way do,"" I finally rasped out. Pulling away, Mia turned herself within my lap to get a better look at me. Placing her small, soft hands across my deep blue cheeks, she whispered, ""I""m so sorry for what my people did to you. I wish I could somehow make it up-"" ""You already have,"" I replied cutting her off. ""You gave me your love, and that is all I need, Mia"" Nuzzling my cheek against her hand, she slowly traced the glowing dots across my skin with a look upon her face that I could only describe as complete love and utter devotion. ""You""ll always have my love, Tsu""tey,"" she whispered, before leaning forward and placing a soft kiss against my cheek. Then, as soon as her lips had been there, they were gone. Before I could do the same to her however, Norm nearly appeared out of thin air next us. ""Mia, Max has the music and mic ready for you whenever you are,"" the tiny, annoying man announced. Rolling my eyes, I urged her to go ahead and follow him. As the two of them ambled on back towards the crowd of Na""vi, I begrudgingly trudged on behind them. Expertly weaving in and out through the large crowd, Mia and Norm soon came upon a man I now knew as Max.",806976
3713,"So he hadn""t managed to slip his fondness for Olivia past his clever sister. ""That would be completely inappropriate."" ""I didn""t hear a no."" Jacques looked at Olivia who looked worried at whatever horrified look he guessed was on his face right now. He turned away from her to hide his blush from her eyes. ""I have to go."" ""Have fun, but not too much fun. Unless your new girlfriend to end up in my situation."" Jacques didn""t like the thrill he felt at the thought of Olivia, pregnant with his child. ""Good-bye, Kit."" ""Good-bye, Jacques."" Good-byes are not the worst last words for beloved siblings to exchange, even when spoken in a tone of ending an annoying conversation rather than sincerity. Though we all hope for better, more eloquent last words, they can be much worse than a simple good-bye. My own last words with my sister, for example, were ""That bonnet makes your forehead look wider than it is."" She left in a huff. How I wish I could told her how much she meant to me, how much I loved her. How crucial she was to me when I was going through the worst moment in my life. As well as the second worst moment of my life. With my brother, my last words were even worse. I told him, ""If I""m not back in five minutes, assume I""m dead and leave without me."" I should have told him, ""If I""m not back in six minutes, assume I""m dead and leave without me."" I wish I would have told him that I always admired and respected him. That I always tried to follow the example he set. I wish I would have told him how I wished him happiness in the future, that I hoped he fell in love at some point in his life even if it didn""t work out, as Snicket romances were prone to do. I wish for a lot of things that will never happen. Pardon my interruption. Jacques hung up the phone, staring at it for a moment, as if worried it might bite him. Why would his sister put such thoughts in his head? He walked out of the phone booth, heading back to the car. Looking at Olivia, whose big brown eyes stared up at him, Jacques felt a tug at his groin, picturing his sister""s suggestion. He didn""t like how he imagined picking Olivia up only to throw her into the back seat of his cab to have his way with her. He looked away from her, ashamed of his dirty thoughts. He told her, ""We should stop here. Get some rest while they rest as well."" She nodded in agreement. Olivia got out of the car. ""Should we get a room?"" Jacques knew it would be a risk. They might be spotted by their enemies if they all wandered around the same hotel. The taxi was parked in a hidden spot already, they might be better off sleeping there. But he guessed while Olivia would kindly go along with whatever he decided, unlike him, she wasn""t used to sleeping in taxis and would probably prefer a bed. He nodded, not trusting his voice, as they walked to the hotel. He looked back at his taxi, fearful of leaving it behind. He considered the old machine his good luck charm. He always managed to get out of any scrape he was in also long as his trusty taxi was waiting for him.",1497577
3584,"For nearly ten minutes he would be helpless and though he had been shot, stabbed, electrocuted, tortured and beaten through the course of his long life Abel was truly terrified at what the insane homunculus might do. Bradley sighed, though he was an unreadable wall with that disapproving scowl of his. ""When you first came into my shop, I spied on you briefly with my ultimate eye and right away I saw the crusnik nanomachines in your body. Even now they are assisting your natural healing which is quite impressive."" Bradley licked his lips, his face devoid of any of the subtle facial twitches found in a human. It was like looking into the face of the combat doll, Father Inques-if Father Inques was a psychopathic cannibal driven by a bottomless well of rage. The ultimate eye stood out brightly compared to Bradley""s green ordinary eye. ""I""m not going to kill you, father,"" he admitted. Abel could only twitch and lay naked, covered in his own blood. Abel""s already pale skin was sallow and blue from oxygen deprivation and his tongue poked out like he was thirsty. It was when Bradley reached out and gently caressed Abel""s throat like a lover, did the crusnik lose his bladder control for the first time in his life. Bradley took no notice of the smell of urine; if anything he was flattered to know that he caused someone else so much pain and misery. He continued to gently caress Abel""s neck in a sensual manner. ""I won""t kill you because I""m not capable of that level of decency."" In a more casual and friendly manner, he told Abel, ""The woman you spoke to, Caterina; she""s alive if the sedative I gave her didn""t cause her to stop breathing."" At the mere mention of his beloved Caterina, Abel began to shake like an insect in its death throes. His paralyzed vocal cords started to make noise but his jaw wouldn""t cooperate; so all that came out was mumbling. Bradley eyed Abel""s wound, he added idly, ""The solid slug in my gun was laced with potent poison; I couldn""t take the chance you would utilize the crusnik nanomachines against me. So we have a bit more time now."" In a condescending manner, Bradley patted Abel on the cheek lightly. His cold features switched briefly to his friendly façade. ""I know you""re a busy man, so I""ll try to keep this brief."" Bradley dropped the façade but did not take up the granite wall face. Instead, his features took on a cast of passion and fascination; here was his big moment. ""Do you have friends, Abel; people that you love?"" The way he used the name ""Abel"" was like it was a swear word. ""Surely you have someone dear to you-I""m going to get them."" Bradley seethed, saliva flooding his mouth and on the verge of foaming at the mouth. ""Do you hear me? I will break their necks, I will make them suffer!"" Bradley leaned in until his and Abel""s faces were nearly touching; the ultimate eye burned into Abel""s brain. ""Be afraid,"" Bradley hissed, ""you""ve got every bloody reason to be afraid of me.""",1220273

""Oh, I have-a never insulted Senior Gaucinii,"" she said, not to Pierre, but to Celeste. Then she burst out laughing and pushed both youth and girl out of her way, her cronies following on her expensive heels. ""Why that excuse for a powder puff,"" Celeste seethed. ""Diamond, Diamond, pay no mind to her,"" Pierre told her. ""She""s not worth the time it takes for an insult."" Celeste sighed. ""You""re right. But since the Prima Donna is heading for the stage, we need to hurry back to our places,"" she picked up her skirt, and they dashed back the way they had come, not even stopping when Pierre kicked an overturned bucket, and staggered to catch up.

Chapter Five: An Alliance Forged in Music The performance went well, in spite of Carlotta""s over emphasis on everything she sang and her inability to act. It was sad how everyone was given the misfortune of watching the red haired woman onstage while a red haired boy rushed here and there in the orchestra pit trying to play the timpani, the chimes, and the cymbals. No one except Celeste, now that she had met the multitalented boy. Afterwards, as patrons and performers all swarmed around Carlotta to congratulate her on her comeback, Celeste stood in the most shadowed place she could find, standing a few feet from the door. She knew Erik would have come, in spite of his insistences that he would never et a foot into a theatre soiled by La Carlotta. She wasn""t disappointed. She felt his fingers on her shoulder as he whispered, ""You were much better tonight."" ""Thank you,"" she said, sipping her glass of wine. She stole a glance back to him. ""Amazing how you can be invisible even wearing all white."" ""I pride myself on it,"" he answered. ""Well, then may I toast you?"" she asked, turning to him, ""To my outstanding teacher, Signor Angeli."" As she and Erik smiled at the joke, a waiter heard them, and set his tray on a table and hurried off to tell the first person he saw, one of the young dancers. When the waiter whispered in her ear, she cried out: ""Where is he? I must meet him! Where is he?"" Senior Fetine heard the commotion, and hurried over. (Fetine) ""What""s all this shouting?"" (Dancer) ""Senior Angeli is with us tonight."" By now the word had gone out, and singers, orchestra members, and a few patrons who""d heard of the reclusive man crowded around. (Ensemble) ""Where is he? Diamond""s Mentor!"" (Cellist) ""Where is he?"" (Alto singer) ""Where is the Master?"" (Waiter) ""I heard Miss Diamond speak to him in the corner."" The waiter pointed to where Celeste had her back turned, and people saw a tall man, his face hidden as he stooped to speak with his pupil. As others stared in awe, unable to move, Carlotta approached the equally awed Manager. (Carlotta) ""Who dares to steal my limelight?""",512464

""What...kind of girls do you like?"" Yuuya asked, a bit fearful and anticipating. Rei answered a bit more quickly. ""...Simple ones..."" He said, in a straight fashion.

Rei curled his lips up in a faltering smile. ""Huh?"" Yuuya shot a weird look at him. Rei suddenly opened his eyes, much to Yuuya""s astonishment. He heaved a sigh, as he made himself comfortable on the tub once more, his sleeping position dragged him too low on the bathtub. ""That was a joke Yuuya. "" Rei gently laughed. "" But you were taking things a bit too far..."" Yuuya looked away, a mild blush in his cheeks. ""So, everything..."" Rei laughed in amusement. "" What I said was true about the girls. But of course, I joked about the thing concerning what guys I like..."" Yuuya heaved a sigh. ""Oh...right."" Then he blanched (a fake one) as if offended by the idea of...that. Rei looked at him, gazing at him as if longingly. Yuuya sensed the stare and his eyes shot at Rei looking at him...a sense of longing and desire in his eyes. ""What?"" Yuuya asked him, as if bewildered. ""I indulged you..."" Rei bought his hands down. ""Shouldn""t you do the same for me?"" ""How? Besides, you tricked me...I thought you were asleep..."" Yuuya protested. Rei sat on one side, his body supported by his right arm, the water riding dangerously low on his hips. Yuuya swore a few inches more and... ""You remembered last night when I told you about getting a tan?"" Rei simply said. ""Yeah..."" Yuuya complied, not getting the point. ""I held you tight...against me."" Rei recalled, unconsciously licking his lips. ""And to tell you the truth, I sorta liked it..."" ""Wait...I thought you said you weren""t keen on the idea of men and..."" Yuuya was now confused. ""I didn""t say anything like that..."" Rei shook his head in mock exasperation.",583064

She pushed the doors open and shut the door behind her locking it. Jamie watched after Catie. He was still in shock at today""s events.

""Listen I know that you want to protect her but keeping her from facing this you are only keeping her back and one day she will regret it and I know you won""t be able to live with her regretting you. She needs to put all this behind her but if she never goes to that police station and identifies the guy, she will never be able to move on with her life. There will always be this voice in the back of her head telling her he""s always out there and he""s going to come back and hurt her again. She needs to face her fears and see them for what they really are, only then will she realize what she has to live for"" Jamie looked at Tyler for a second and then advanced his stare at Brooke and Val who were nodding and then he turned to Hank who was doing the same thing. Jamie shook his head and stared at the bathroom and started to walk towards the bathroom but Tyler stopped him. ""You mind if I take this one?"" Jamie hesitated but then nodded. ""Um sure go ahead"" Tyler nodded and walked towards the bathroom. He raised his fist and knocked on the bathroom door. ""Catie, it""s me Tyler. Can I come in? I""m by myself, no Jamie, no Val, no nobody"" Tyler waited a second but then smiled when he heard the door un-lock. He winked at Val and walked into the bathroom to find Catie sitting in the corner. ""Lock the door"" Tyler nodded and locked the door and looked back to Catie. She was crawled up in a little ball with dry tears on her face. ""You mind if I sit next to you?""",29783
1155,"""You""re not going to get her!"" ""You know that you hurt her right?"" ""Daniel stop!"" ""You make her feel bad about herself. You wish she was someone who she isn""t and that hurts her down deep"" Jack looks over at Fi. ""I""m sorry Jack"" Jack continues to look at Fi and sees the hurt in her eyes. Carey, Annie and Clu just remain quiet not knowing what to do. ""Jack you had your chance to make your sister happy now give me mine. I can love her for who she is something you could never do. She is going to live here with me"" Wind blows through the house and Fi and Jack are getting farther and farther away. Jack looks at his sister who is growing more distant. No time like the present. ""You don""t even know her"" The wind continues to blow and it starts to rain. ""What are you talking about Jack? I see her for who she is... I know her more then you ever will"" ""See Daniel that is where you are wrong. You don""t know her. What is her favorite color?"" Silence. ""Blue except on Mondays...Mondays she likes the color red, she thinks liking only one thing makes you dull and boring. Her favorite cartoon show when she was younger was Scooby Doo and her favorite character was Thelma because Thelma was so smart. She only likes my mom doing her hair because she says I pull her hair too tight and make her pony-tail lopsided but I""m the only one she likes kissing her boo-boo""s but of course that was when she was 10. She cries over the silliest of things... she cried for days after watching Old Yeller. She always bites on her bottom lip when she is nervous... her feet do the jello dance when she is excited and her favorite movie is E.T and she thinks that Drew Barrymore was so cute in that movie."" Fi looks at Jack and smiles. ""Oh so you know stuff... but I will make her happy ... that is the big plan"" ""No. The big plan is for me and her to grow old together. We are gonna be 99 and still fighting over if aliens exist or not. I""m supposed to scare off all of her boyfriends. I""m supposed to hold her after her first break up with a guy. I""m supposed to make chicken noodle soup every time she is sick. Hold her and reassure everything is okay when she is afraid. Trade phone calls and write letters if she goes to a different college then me. Think of her when she is not near me. Stay up late with her listening to her awesome date or party she went to even if I really want to go to sleep. We""re supposed to share juicy secrets with each other but she""ll always keep the ones about all the boys that like her to herself cause she knows I""ll hunt them down and kill them myself. We""re supposed to be there for each other.... Comforting each other. We""ll have fights but we will always make up by the end of the night because we both know how short life can be. I""m supposed to say I love you a million times and annoy the heck out of her. I""m supposed to be extremely happy when she gets married and take tons of pictures... that is the big plan. Cause I love her no matter what... I love all her little quirks and flaws...",29783
545,"With a conflicted look on her face, the twin-tailed tennis prodigy simply sighed as she slowly made her way down the hill towards her home. It was bad enough that No-Stars had such bad living accommodations, stuck in the slums down below, forced to ride an air-trolley up to class. Truth be told, It was only a sudden desire to be alone that made Omiko take the walk in the first place. The last thing she wanted to hear was the yammering of other No-Stars interrupting her personal thoughts. But the fates seemed to have a different plan for on this day. She didn""t hear his foot-falls at first, but Omiko certainly felt the heavy impact of his boxing right hand on her back as he touched her. Surprised out of her wits, the blonde snarled in surprise before turning around to see none other that Takaharu, a smile on his face as he greeted her. ""Hakodate-san! I didn""t know you walked home this way."" Omiko simply grimaced at his strangely sunny smile. ""Ugh, what are you doing here? Haven""t you been enough of a nuisance for one day?"" That seemed to be enough to wipe the smile off of Takaharu""s face. He stood sullen as Omiko continued walking, clearly not wanting anything to do with him. But the boxer was not ready to give up, and he ran right after, at least as quick as his short legs could carry him. ""Hey, hey! We""re not in class anymore. You don""t have to be such a shar-"" Realizing exactly what he was about to say, the boxer proceeded to punch himself in the mouth in order to stop himself from finishing that last word. Unfortunately for him, his reflexes weren""t fast enough, and Omiko""s ear drums were faster. The twin-tailed blonde got right up in his face, baring her teeth in her anger. ""What was that? What were you going to say?"" she pressed him, just hoping to hear that dreaded s-word so that she had the excuse she needed to slap Takaharu silly. The boy seemed unable to respond at first, but after a few seconds, he uncovered his mouth and let out a sigh. ""Nothing. Just forget I said anything."" he remarked, putting his head down as he realized his efforts to be nice were simply in vain. Omiko simply crossed her arms, not finished with him just yet. ""What is it with you?"" she asked, clearly annoyed. ""I mean, what do you want me to say? I get it. You beat me today. But if you think for even a second that it""s going to happen again, then let me tell you s-"" Takaharu was waved his arms like an umpire as he interrupted her. ""Will you let me breathe? I swear, talking to you is as exhausting as an afternoon of strength training!"" ""Then why are you talking to me?"" she questioned, rudeness overflowing from her voice. ""Why don""t you go back to punching those dead animals you boxers love practicing on so much?"" Takaharu seemed unable to handle any more of it, and thus his emotions got the better of him. ""BECAUSE! I""M! TRYING! TO! BE! NICE!"" he shouted. His voice exploded with the same power and fighting spirit that he showed when declaring his boxing technique, and a red aura of pure fighting spirit seemed to form around him.",967934
2083,"Willy hurried over to the bed. There was a heavy-looking cast on Anastasia""s arm resting in a sling hanging from the ceiling. Although she had on a white hospital gown, Willy could see the outlines of the tight bandages around her rib cage. He also noticed that her stomach had sagged down, empty of its secret. Willy carefully touched her forehead, then stroked her hair out of her face. He found it hard to believe that through all of this, that she would be okay. He leaned closer and kissed her on the lips. ""Mr. Wonka? There""s someone here to see you."" A nurse said from behind him. He turned to see her holding a tiny baby in her arms. She let out a muffled cry and reached out her little hands. Willy took the baby into his arms. ""Nice to meet you, Rose,"" he whispered. The nurse smiled and left them alone. ""I""m Willy, and this,"" Willy said, holding the baby up to Anastasia""s cheek, ""is your mother."" The baby made a ""uh!"" sound. Willy felt his eyes fill up again, but he wasn""t sad. It was an overwhelming feeling to have something so small and warm and helpless cradled in his arm that would, in a few years, grow to be anything that her heart desired to be. Anastasia had woken up. ""Where""s my baby!"" she moaned, only just aware of being quite sore and with an empty womb. ""Anastasia!"" Willy gasped, turning around. She gave him a soft smile. ""Look who came to see you."" Willy said, holding the baby down to where she could see it. Anastasia sat up abruptly, cringing in pain from her ribs. She held out her good arm. ""Are you sure-"" Willy started to ask. ""William Wonka, if you don""t let me see my baby, you""ll sing soprano when I""m not strapped to this bed!"" Anastasia threatened. Willy wasn""t sure if she was kidding of not. He eased the baby into her good arm, and she kissed Rose on the forehead. Rubbing her cheek against Rose""s soft, warm skin, her eyes filled with joyful tears. ""You""re okay, thank God! Little baby girl, do you know how long I""ve waited for this?"" She continued talking to the baby. What surprised Willy was that she could still be loving and happy and still talk like an adult to the baby. It wasn""t like mother and child: it was like they were equal. ""I was afraid you girls weren""t going to make it,"" Willy said, trembling. Anastasia""s cooing over Rose stopped abruptly. ""You were?"" she asked, her expression very serious. ""I love you."" Willy blurted out before he had a chance to think about it. Anastasia looked mildly surprised. ""Anastasia, I""m quite serious."" Anastasia tried to say something, but the words didn""t come. Just as Willy""s heart began to crumble, Anastasia took in a sharp breath. ""I""m glad. I love you, too Willy. And unless you want me to, I""m not leaving. "" Willy""s lips were glued to her instantly, but it wasn""t just a light kiss like usual. Anastasia deepened the kiss. He needed to hold her. He needed...something. Anastasia spent about three months in the hospital, and Willy didn""t leave her side. He helped her with everything, and he even listened to the nurses while they instructed him on how to feed and change the baby.",870118
416,"Throughout the many, many rooms he searched, nothing felt out of place. A normal, old, forgotten mansion in the woods from a time long gone by. Somehow, it didn""t feel the like the same place he had been in before yet that was just pure speculation on his part. Candles attached to the walls were cold and unused. The moonlight only lit so much of the inner rooms and that was only if that room had any windows. Some of the outer rooms didn""t have windows, and he had to stop himself from wondering why. Although the house didn""t seem like the same place as before, something was off. Maybe it was just Hisoka""s imagination at work, and that thought seemed to insistently pester him throughout the night. He had spent at least an hour exploring the place and probably only managed to cover a quarter of the first floor. Sometimes, however, he could swear that he could hear the faint echos of someone laughing. This place, he knew, was starting to get to his head. Seeing as how he was part of the not-living but not-dead world, the worst part about his fears was that he knew ghosts and monsters actually existed. Wind whistled through the hallways, scratching and small animal noises were crawling in the walls. A slow ascended to the upper floor only cause Hisoka""s own fear to worsen. The higher up he went, the worse he felt about his surroundings. In a short test, he had walked down the stairs and out the front doors and in all that while, he felt slightly better each step until he passed the entrance. Not that ""safe"" really meant actually, truly safe but at least that horrible foreboding didn""t shadow over him like a black rain cloud. Even though he should have been alone, gentle, soften nudges poked his mind with foreign emotions and feelings from an unknown source. Unless he could read animals, which could be the case if Muraki once resided here, then anything would be possible. If his own mind wasn""t confused and in pain, he probably would never have come back here in the first place. Going back into the house felt like a death sentence but that thought was just his own fears turning against him. The worst part about the mansion was the shadows in the corners of his eyes. He was expecting something to come popping out at any moment so his mind was actively searching for something that would move. He wanted to hear if sounds were being made by something unnatural. What he felt as he ascended the stairs a second time, the increased dread. The unsettled, ""something is not right here"" thought that ran over and over in his mind. He knew he shouldn""t have come alone, but in the end it was his own decision to do it. Why he acted alone now, instead of relying on his partner cross his mind, and the more he thought about it the more he wished he were at home with Tsuzuki instead of here by himself. His mind was conflicted, wanting to both experience self punishment for his past and trying to escape from it at the same time. With Tsuzuki, he always felt a little bit better about himself but somewhere inside, maybe he really, really didn""t deserve those feelings.",583994
147,"-------NC-17-------- John felt Andy""s hands trail down his stomach to his pants and slowly began to undo them and slide them off. Now the only thing keeping them from each other was their underwear. John stopped what he was doing and looked up into her face full of wanting, but he wanted to make sure, ""Andy are you sure about this. You""re not going to turn back, "" John said looking right at her. Andy smiled as she leaned up and kissed him on the lips and then pulled away to say, ""At least this time we won""t be drunk John. Yes I want you so badly you have no clue."" John smiled and kissed her again before he pulled her underwear off and took all of her beauty in. Before John went further though he leaned over the side of the bed and pulled out from under it a metal box and opened it. He began to search for something and soon found it while smiling. When he pulled it out Andy couldn""t help, but laugh a little. ""Let""s hope this one doesn""t break. I made sure to get the best and not the cheap,"" John said waving around a Trojan Condom. Andy laughed as she pulled him down to kiss him again before she pulled away and said, ""Good, because Johnny is all I can handle right now."" John laughed as he began to kiss her even more. Soon he pulled down his boxers, undid the package, and slid it on. In one short move him plunged inside of her. Andy couldn""t help, but moan loudly as he stretched her. He sure as hell was short, or small. Even though she wasn""t a virgin it still hurt a little, but with every thrust it soon turned into pure pleasure. They both moaned into each other whispering each other""s names. Soon Andy came first followed by John who was relieved that Andy""s nails had receded from his back. John just laid there on her for a second catching his breath, but all the while staring into her eyes. After he was sure he had enough air in his lungs he leaned down and took her lips in a sweet kiss. Andy kissed him back as she wrapped her arms around his neck. When he pulled away he took another minute to just lie there in her arms. John soon pulled out and pulled the condom off and threw it away, quickly wiping himself off. When he was done he laid down beside her as stretched out his arm so that she could snuggle up against him and he could hold her against his chest. ---------- End of NC-17---------------- ""At least the condom didn""t break this time,"" John said as he steadied his breathing. Andy laughed and said, ""Yay, no more babies for me to give birth to."" John laughed and said, ""Yeah and no more screaming in labor mother killing my hand."" ""Yeah about that...I""m sorry,"" Andy said as John looked over at her and laughed as he said, ""Don""t worry. I took nothing you said or did true, because I knew you must have been in pain."" Andy smiled and kissed him on the cheek, ""Your such a forgiving boyfriend."" John""s heart halted at that word and he opened his eyes and turned toward her. She saw his face and knew that he had taken that word serious. ""So you""re saying we are together officially,"" John said.",806976
750,"""Do you really think you are the end all for me Bruce?"" He became uncomfortable, shifting beneath her. She let the question hang for a moment before lowering her head and observing, ""How vain is man."" The arms that were wrapped loosely around his neck became more solid, now actually holding him, her fingers caressing his neck. ""Tell me something real about yourself, Bruce. Something no one else knows."" Bruce leaned forward and kissed her forehead, mostly for distraction. ""Impossible, my life is an open book."" That made Selina lean back and grab his head so she could face him properly. ""Bullshit. I know for a fact that""s not true."" ""How do you know?"" He challenged. ""Most of the time we spend together, we""re humping."" ""You""d be amazed to know that sex is often one of the better times to get know who a person really is."" He had to retrain himself from growling and shutting down completely. ""Why don""t you tell me something about me then?"" She held his gaze, meeting his challenge. ""You""re smarter than you let on."" Bruce""s gut dropped. ""Seriously, I googled you. Before your parents"" died, some considered you a prodigy. And you were kicked out of the best schools on the East coast because of behavioral problems, not grades."" She""d researched him? This was not a good sign. ""And google is such a reliable source. Besides, that was years ago, now..."" ""Now you""re with me, Bruce. If you were really as dumb as those bimbos you take out..."" ""Do I detect a hint of jealousy?"" Bruce wanted to get the upper hand, and hoped to spark her fury. She continued on as if he said nothing at all. ""...you""d be with one of them, not me, right now. But, no, you actually do want a woman with a brain rather than as many notches on your bedpost as you can get. Why are you so determined to have everyone have such low expectations of you?"" She studied him for a moment, and saw his refusal to answer so she added, ""It also shows your fear of getting close to anyone, but let""s tackle one issue at a time."" She was hitting way too close to home. Bruce wanted to shift the focus. ""What about you? Tell me something I don""t know about you."" She knew what he was doing. ""I""m a wonderful liar."" He smiled, hoping to return her to a more playful mood. ""I hate to break it to you, but I knew that within five minutes of meeting you."" ""But not why."" She paused. ""My parents were very strict."" ""Were?"" ""They died when I was fourteen. Horrible age to be orphaned at, when you think you can take care of yourself but you can""t. My last words to my mother were ""I hate you.'"" ""At least you remember your last words. I can""t remember what I said in my head and what I said out loud. I don""t know the moment they died. It just all jumbled together."" She looked at the broken man in her arms and began to kiss their mutual pain away. He grabbed her waist tighter and pulled her to him and they sank into the couch together. It was the first time it wasn""t sex or fucking. It was the first time Bruce stayed the night. He walked out in the morning light, knowing she was far too close.",1497577
308,"You look like you woke up from the grave. But what else is new?] Yuuki""s voice suddenly gained an angered tone. As if sensing her rising rage, the wind simply howled like a crazed animal, nearly drowning out Yuuki""s voice. ""All I hear is fear. You are hiding behind your jokes and your accursed machine. You""ve always been hiding by that machine."" Switch""s typing seemed to become faster. The synthesized voice had become determined. [There is nothing you can do to frighten me. Go ahead. Try all you want. But in the end, I will always stand triumphant.] There was a moment of silence between Yuuki and Switch as she processed his words. Then her expression began to contort, and her eyes bulged with what Switch might have assumed was insanity. Yuuki""s slender hands went for Switch""s face, cupping themselves around it as she stared deeply into his eyes. Switch could do nothing, for once. His mind began to drift, and Yuuki noticed what she thought might be a small change in his eyes. She could see some sort of emotion screaming to break out. She could feel her face start to tingle. Sparks of excitement rushed through her entire body. The occult girl would help this trapped emotion find its way out. ""Nothing can scare you, Switch-kun? Fool! I""ll show you true fear whether you want it or not!"" Yuuki declared, before her lips went for his. The wind slowed as Yuuki and Switch were caught up in their silent embrace. Yuuki""s hair waved in the breeze, and Switch""s fingers remained poised just above his keyboard. He wanted to type; to say something, anything, just to end the silence. But for the first time in a long time, Switch could not control his emotions. His eyes could only stare ahead at Yuuki, unwavering as they saw the soft expression on her face. It was strange. The longer she kissed him, the more Switch found her face becoming more and more pleasant. She was just on the edge of beauty for him before she finally let go. The dark blush on Yuuki""s face was easily obvious. Switch fixed his glasses before standing up straight again. He wore a blank stare as Yuuki moved back in an attempt to give him some space. She searched for any sign of happiness, surprise, or even disgust, on Switch""s face, but she could find nothing. Looking down at the leaf-covered ground, Yuuki could feel her heart beat finally slowing down. The moment of ecstasy that came with finally kissing a boy had passed, only to be replaced by a horrible emptiness. Then came the typing. It was a terrible sound to Yuuki""s ears, and it came with an even more terrible response. [It seems my analysis on this circle of trees is complete. I""m finished with you for today, Yuuki-san.] Switch didn""t even say goodbye. He was far down the path out of the forest as Yuuki still had her gaze fixed on the ground. Each one of his steps continued to repeat in her mind. His words had practically burned into her psyche. When she tried to walk, she found that her legs had become weak, and she had to lean on one of the nearby trees for support.",967934
459,"Hopefully within that amount of time nothing would happen to the O""Connell family, and maybe he might just make it in time to warn them. So, was this chapter any better than the original?

Telling The O""Connell""s+ Even though Alex was 19 he still lived with his parents to help out in their digs and besides where else did he have to go. He was sitting on a chair looking outside when he heard his father walk into the room and said, ""Alex, Why don""t you help me with these boxes."" ""Sure dad,"" Alex got up and picked up a box and only found that the bottom had fallen out letting hay and a huge box object fall on the floor. Rick cursed himself for letting him help and said, ""Actually change of thought clean that up and go out and have a good time. Party with some girls like your Uncle Jonathan dose,"" Rick said. ""I""m fine dad I""ll just clean this up and go for a walk I need some air anyway,"" Alex said smiling. Rick had always thought that child a little weird when he hit fourteen. He seemed to become more like his mother than himself. Alex was cleaning up the mess while Rick walked away with the box he had in his hand. Alex was too busy to notice that the box was open to reveal a medallion with Hieroglyphics on it and in the middle was carved a city. He picked it out and looked at it and stuffed it in his pocket to save for later when he wanted to study it. He closed the box not noticing the two daggers in there. He stuffed the box on the table after cleaning up the hay mess and throwing it away. Alex then walked toward the door to walk out when he heard someone knocking on it. ----------Cairo Museum----------- Jamila walked up the steps with her parents who were dressed like people during her time and they didn""t look too bad. She had made Imhotep leave the soldiers nearby but not close enough where people could see them. She walked through the doors of the Museum and immediately walked to the door of one of the offices. She walked in on a man who was doing some work. ""What did I tell you, I specifically told you I was to not be disturbed Mrs. Kip,"" the man said as he looked down onto the papers. ""Well I wouldn""t disturb you, but I""m not Mrs. Kip,"" now the man looked up at Jamila with a horrified face. ""What are you doing in here, I""ll have the police on you if you don""t get out,"" the man said. ""Ha I quite doubt that,"" Jamila said as she grabbed the man by his shirt. ""What do you want,"" the man asked in fear. ""You""re the brother of the man who helped Imhotep last time right,"" Jamila said. ""Yes,"" the man said quivering in fear.",806976

""I was-"" ""It""s none of your business Hermano, I was gonna put her nack in anyways."" ""What?!"" Her fists clenched and her teeth gritted, he crossed his arms and glared sternly at her. ""I can""t just let you go walking around and doing whatever you want."" Vaas snorted. ""Who the fuck do you think I am? Fucking Willy Wonka or something? Benny put her away."" Vaas turned to leave stopping when Benny didn""t do as he said at the sharp rage filled glare that she sent in his direction. Vaas slanted himself to look at her comfortable, annoyance written all over his every move. ""Who the fuck do you think I am? I am going with you."" She demanded, nonchalantly somehow, stepping forward without fear until she was an inch from Vaas""s body. Some part of her hoping intimidation would work, but she knew better. ""Excuse me?"" He remained with a straight face. They stared into each other""s eyes for what felt like hours, but was only seconds. ""Fine, you can go with me, but if you try anything-"" ""I know you""ll kill me."" ""No... I""m gonna torture the shit out of you first and then kill you, then drag you from hell and kill you again."" She broke their stare, but his hand shot up quick to grab her chin and pull her gaze back to his. ""You do understand that whatever fucking game you""re playing, i""m not playing it anymore and I make the rules around here. It""s done, you do as I say and be a good dog, understand?"" The tone of his voice was dripping with heinous meaning and violent promise, his eyes proved that he was not joking whatsoever. He was merely curious as to how this would play out, but if he caught the slightest bit of her escapade... He wouldn""t hesitate to make her live the longest and most painful death he had ever given. ""I U-Understand."" She stuttered in turn, the corners of his lips quirking up, he released the threatening grip on her chin. ""Good. Let""s go."" He walked on his way before she could follow, Benny grabbed her forearm. She glanced at him, his eyes were worried as was his features. ""You be careful, okay?"" For a moment she forgot everything, he cared about her as a friend and more, while she only cared about him as a friend. She took what she needed, pulling herself into his arms and giving him a hug, he didn""t mind, wrapping his arms around her in turn. Vaas whistled breaking them from their embrace, she tore herself from him and walked up to Vaas. Benny watching as she left, feeling a sudden uplifting confidence that gave him the strength to go and do his duties for the day... He loved her. ""I get up, and nothing gets me down. You got it tough~. I""ve seen the toughest a~ll around~."" Vaas thumped his fingers on the steering wheel as he dramatically sung to the music. The entire time Lunetta kept her distance, thinking about what she would do once they arrived in Badtown. She thought it would be music the entire ride there, but was surprised when Vaas turned the radio off looking between her and the road every so often. ""So...",6234395

2267,"Before the coachman could open the door, it sprang open and a boy only slightly older than Kyo bounded out. Tohru""s eyes widened in shock: he had the whitest hair she""d ever seen! And part of it was black! ""Finally! I thought I was going to go crazy in there!"" he exclaimed. A very worn-out Hatori emerged as well. ""You aren""t the only one,"" he said dryly, causing everyone to chuckle. Then, a tall, slender black-haired girl emerged as well. Her eyes were very dark and she had a stony expression. Her skin was nearly as pale as Akito""s, Tohru noticed, and she seemed wary of the whole place. She didn""t speak to anyone, just stood there with her arms crossed. ""Hatsuharu, Isuzu, this is Tohru Honda. She""s come to live with us,"" Hatori introduced them. Hatsuharu bowed, then offered his hand immediately, his glacier-colored eyes glinting mischievously. ""I was hoping you""d be a little older,"" he said with a wink. Tohru""s cheeks colored. ""Haru,"" Yuki said in a scolding voice. ""Yeah, yeah, I know! I""m supposed to be on my best behavior,"" he sneered. Tohru glanced over at Isuzu. She hardly inclined her head at all, but it was enough of a bow to maintain propriety. ""You""ll have to pardon Isuzu,"" Hatori said quietly, ""she isn""t feeling well. She often gets travel-sickness."" ""I understand completely,"" Tohru said sympathetically. ""Kagura, why don""t you take her upstairs so she can lie down before dinner?"" Hatori asked. Kagura took Isuzu""s suitcases and led her inside. Isuzu acted as if she didn""t really want to go, but she followed. ""She hates being here,"" Hatsuharu said, ""that""s what""s making her sick."" Hatori gave Haru a sharp look and he silenced immediately. ""There""s no need to air her personal problems in front of the children, Haru. You should go and freshen up before dinner as well."" ""Fine, fine,"" he said dismissively, ""try and get rid of me. Everybody does."" He went inside, stomping a little louder than necessary. Hatori sighed. ""Everything is all ready for you, sir,"" one of the maids said, ""your chamber is all prepared."" ""I appreciate it being done on such short notice,"" Hatori said, ""I""m afraid you""ll have your hands full until we get this matter of school straightened out."" Tohru had an uneasy feeling in her stomach. What was going on here? ""You three had better get inside,"" Okami told them, ""you may wait in the parlor-sit quietly until you are called."" Tohru very nearly slipped up and asked about Akito being there, but she kept her mouth shut when she saw Okami walking away looking even more frazzled than usual. Akito was supposed to be a secret, she knew. Dinner was a bizarrely formal affair. Yuki and Kyo weren""t normally allowed here; they usually went home for dinner, but all of the Zodiac members save Akito were together. Tohru couldn""t stop looking at everything in the spacious dining room. Here, things were a little more traditionally Asian: the table was low and everyone was sitting on cushions rather than chairs. They ate out of small bowls, one course at a time. Hardly anyone really talked, as everyone was tired and hungry.",870118
1573,""".../omg"" Byakko wasn""t able to believe what he was seeing. That scrawny Morroc lad was now a fine thief. Glad to see him, the silver haired boy invited him for ice cream in the inn. Lutie was snowing well this year that ice cream had been available for everyone. ""So...how""s...your...training...""ShadowEyes asked in between licks of his triple scooped ice cream. Byakko just gave a /... reply. ""It""s been kinda hard...specially for a person like me...Ooops..."" Slip of the tongue. ""What do you mean ""for a person like me""? Huh?"" ShadowEyes looked up from his treat. Though naïve for his age, he knew well what to listen to and what not to listen. ""Nothing..."" Byakko replied, rolling his eyes up and giving a tone of suspense. ""Hey cool! What card is compounded in here? I wanna see..."" The pony-tailed kid began examining a rather familiar looking chain on his hand. ""Hey, give that back!!!"" Byakko was startled, not realizing that it was gone by his side. Shadow, on the meantime, brought the weapon out of reach from his hand and teased the other boy. ""Damnation Chain eh? This could sell big..."" Shadow stuck his tongue out against the annoyed boy. The drama lasted on for a few minutes until an aura of desperation surrounded the acolyte. ""Give...that...BACK!"" Byakko finally reached the other boy, grasping the arm with his hand that was hidden underneath the long sleeves of his acolyte getup. Shadow was shocked when a different set of hands grabbed his arm, it was clawed and very strong. Letting go of the chain, his sights settled on the other boy. His eyes had narrowed to slits and his canines had grown a few centimeters more than what he had remembered. Quick as a flash, Byakko let go and seemed like he fell back down to earth. His hands returned to normal, his pupils dilated to those of a normal one and his fangs had returned to their normal length. Panting the boy""s head fell on the table. ""Haa...haa...please...don""t provoke me again...I...lose my control if you or anybody does..."" Tears fell out of either pain or shame. Shadow felt it was both. ""Listen...I""m sorry. Here,"" he said returning the chain to Byakko. ""but really. Tell me what I just saw and what happened here."" Seeing how futile it is to hide it to him, Byakko narrated everything about himself. Everything... ""I see...well, it makes sense anyway. No wonder those ears grow long, or either your fangs grow extra large when you grow angry."" Shadow finally heaved a sigh after the long story. ""Yeah...so, you gonna start running away now and tell the world what a freak I am? If you""re lucky, you might have a large reward for turning in the son of an MVP...""Byakko looked away. ""Nah..."" Shadow stood up from his seat. Walking out of the café, he winked at the startled acolyte. ""...There are things more important than zennies, y""know!"" And with that, the thief disappeared into the crowd. Byakko smiled as he gazed his gloved hands. ""There are things more important, eh?",583064
2414,"She tilted her head charmingly and gave me a beatific smile. ""Thank you."" I was startled when I felt my heart beat loudly, before I returned it -- a genuine smile. It was my first real smile of that day. I thought about Miyazawa most of the evening, and I think I dreamed about her, though I don""t recall what those dreams were. I think I was glad that was the case. It was one of those dreams that adolescent males are plagued with, and I was well-overdue for a fantasy or two about a classmate. And by choosing Miyazawa, I had proven that I was perfectly ordinary guy, when it came down to the baser instincts. Miyazawa was the prettiest girl in class, after all. I met her outside the shoeboxes. She was holding her outdoor shoes in one hand, and rummaging through her box with another. I noticed how she pulled out two love letters, looked at them for a second, before I opened my own. To my relief, today was one of those rare days when I didn""t have any inside waiting for me. I looked at her as she blushed at me slightly. ""Admirers?"" I inquired. ""You should know,"" she teased me playfully. ""Maybe one of these was put into my box by mistake?"" she suggested. ""Um. I doubt it..."" I said, though it was a possibility. When I had been in junior high, it had happened about four times -- misdirected love letters. The result of one of the incidents had been downright hilarious, but once the poor girl had been so humiliated she had transferred schools. The human heart is a funny thing. With a sigh, she pulled on her indoor shoes onto her feet before turning to the letters with slightly tired eyes. She opened one, read it quickly, then opened the other. Miyazawa looked thoughtful for a minute before she opened a day planner and scribbled a few notes in it. I wanted to ask her who they were from, but I knew it was none of my business. I wanted to take them out of her hands and shred them to pieces. I was startled by the urge. I barely knew her. She gave me a smile. ""Do you know Enomoto-kun?"" she asked. I blinked. ""Isn""t he in class D?"" I asked. Miyazawa frowned thoughtfully. ""I think so. I just can""t place the face to the name,"" she confessed, and then she looked guilty. ""I""m supposed to meet him at lunch."" I almost offered to go with her. Stupid me. Miyazawa could handle herself. She gave me a smile. ""Chiyako-san still isn""t dating anyone, is she?"" ""Not that I know of."" A week ago Asano Chiyako had given me a love note, and as far as I knew, she still hadn""t recovered from my gentle rejection enough to pursue another boy. ""Hmm... I think she""d get along nicely with Tamura-kun. Maybe I should redirect his attention that way,"" she mused aloud, tapping her pen against her chin. ""Redirect?"" I echoed. She nodded. ""I really don""t think Tamara-kun and I""d make a good couple- but he and Chiyako-san have a lot in common, and she""s desperate for a date."" I smiled at her. It had never occurred to me to redirect the attention of my admirers, but Miyazawa was a lot more considerate than I was.",1112924
575,"She kept the trance, so he took her arm. ""Callie, let""s go, give these two some space."" She looked at him now, though it took a few moments for her eyes to focus. ""What? I""m far too drunk to drive."" He began pulling her up and walking her to his truck. ""I""m not. I""ll give you a ride back to the hospital."" She frowned at her car, which had made him chuckle when he first pulled up. ""But my car..."" Owen opened the passenger door. ""I""ll be nice and give you a ride again tomorrow when you""re sober and you can pick it up."" He helped her into the truck like a true gentleman and she smiled at him. ""No wonder Yang""s sleeping with you."" Owen sighed. He tried to explain why he was naked in Cristina""s bed that morning without revealing any details, but it was useless. He closed her door and walked to the driver""s street. ""Bailey is looking at us."" Callie leaned in closer to the glass, trying to get a better look. ""Do you think that is a glare? I think she""s pissed."" ""I""m not looking at Bailey."" Callie glanced over at Owen, and it was true. His eyes were trained only on Cristina. If it hadn""t been for the booze, Callie might have been able to repress the eye roll, but really she should""ve known, it was nothing new. She looked at Bailey again. Bailey""s attention was no longer on the gallery; she was looking at Cristina with an unreadable look on her face. Alex looked like someone had just told him his favorite puppy hadn""t gone to a special puppy farm after all. Callie wondered what was going on down there. She wasn""t used to this perspective when it came to surgery. She felt like a spectator at a sporting event. As the surgery continued Callie began to grow bored. Why were they here? Cristina was rocking it out. Of course she was, she was Cristina freaking Yang. Her first solo surgery could""ve been nothing but a success. Callie knew it. Cristina knew it. Owen knew it. Everyone knew it. So, Callie did the same thing she did when she got bored at a sporting event. She rose from the seat she""d taken and began cheering and shouting. ""Go Cristina! Woah! Rock it out, Yang!"" Owen wasn""t watching Cristina anymore. He was trying to quiet Callie and to get her to sit back down again. Callie caught sight of Bailey""s eyes; she was definitely glaring now. A/N: So, haven""t written one of these in awhile (or much of anything really) mostly due to the fact that I""ve been displeased with the direction of the show in recent seasons. (See how kept that nice and civil?) But I actually do like April and Avery as a couple, so here goes... Don""t Think Avery tried not to think about it. He tried not to think about how Mark began to die while he was stealing his daughter for him. He tried not to think about how he hadn""t had a chance to take him up on his last piece of advice. He tried not to think about April leaving without ever knowing... Avery also didn""t like to think about the night before the boards, partly because it also caused him to need some ""alone time,' but mostly because it just reminded of how badly he""d messed everything up.",1497577
2576,"""I would kill just to find a man who would buy me this adorable ring!"" she gushed. Beside her, Sakura looked up from the necklace displays. ""Shikamaru wouldn""t be pleased to hear that,"" she admonished. ""Shikamaru? Why would it be him?"" Ino raised her eyebrows, appalled. ""Anyway, do you think Sai would be able to afford this?"" ""Sai?"" The pink-haired girl echoed questioningly. ""Since when have you and Sai been an item?"" The blonde heaved a heavy sigh as she patted Sakura""s shoulders. ""My poor girl, you""ve been away from the gossip ring for weeks now. Sasuke is really keeping you all to himself, huh?"" She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. ""Is he that good?"" A light blush colored her cheeks. ""Ino!"" Ino rolled her eyes. ""You""re such a virgin, Sakura."" She turned back to admiring the ring. ""Ah..my dear ring.. one day you""ll be mine."" Sakura was quietly inspecting the necklaces in search for a gift for Tsunade when Ino suddenly pulled her hand. ""Hey!"" ""Let me see!"" Ino said excitedly as she examined Sakura""s simple wedding ring made of gold. She scowled in disappointment. ""That""s it? Sasuke is so freaking rich he can even buy my ring!"" she claimed as she pointed to the diamond ring, ""And yet he settled for a very simple one? Sakura, you should have asked-no, demanded-for something much more extravagant!"" Pulling her hand back defensively, Sakura frowned. ""Don""t insult it!"" ""What? Is it some kind of Uchiha heirloom? A keepsake from his mother or something?"" Ino asked, mildly interested. ""But it doesn""t look old."" Sakura toyed with the ring on her finger, a habit she had developed recently. ""It""s not."" ""Figures. Sasuke isn""t the sentimental type, huh,"" Ino said sympathetically. ""Ah.. Still you should have demanded for a more expensive ring!"" ""It""s all right."" And Sakura gazed at the ring, a smile on her face. The ring and its pair, while not Uchiha heirlooms, were special, not because of their price but the nature of when they were bought. While Sasuke vowed not to let her know, it was Naruto who told her that the rings were bought almost a year ago, during the first month Sasuke returned home, when he first thought of finally settling down with her. Granted, it took months to find its owner. Still, she knew he chose them delicately, instructed how they were to be engraved with their names, kept them in his person at all times, waiting for that right moment. And, for Sakura, those were worth more than diamond rings. Thank you for reading! Please do review! :D Happy Day 6 everyone! Prompt 6: Night In Uchiha Sasuke was supposed to spend a quiet night at home, leisurely reading a scroll or two. Instead, he found himself in the Hokage Tower, surrounded by a mountain of scrolls, his hand blackened with ink. His eyes twitched in annoyance as he sorted through the scrolls. ""Tell me again why I""m helping you?"" Naruto""s head popped from behind his own mountain of scrolls, a wide grin on his face. ""Because you""re my best friend, Sasuke."" He waved his hand dismissively. ""Besides, Sakura""s not even at home-she""s on her own Night Out!""",560480
1641,"Pike chuckled. ""I""m glad to see you came, Jim. Even if you are late."" Kirk didn""t seem phased in the least, and hurriedly followed as Pike motioned them to come in. Standing in the doorway of what could only be called a foyer, Bones sized the man up. So this was Christopher Pike. Well. At least he seemed more hygienic than some other friends of Kirk""s father he had met. ""You must be Dr. McCoy,"" Pike said, reaching out a hand in greeting. ""Jim told me he was bringing you."" Bones shook it. "" And you must be Christopher Pike."" He hesitated a second before continuing. ""I""m a little surprised to see your place. Doesn""t seem like someone who already has money would take the risk of robbing a bank just to get more."" It may not have been the smartest move to just lay his concerns out on the table, but Bones had never exactly been one for subtlety or mind games. Pike smiled. ""An astute observation, Doctor. For now let""s just say that money isn""t my only concern in this job."" Bones was surprised that the man had admitted to that much, but he decided to drop his questioning. For then at least. ""So, Pike,"" Kirk said, getting back in on the conversation. ""About this team you mentioned..."" ""They""re waiting in the parlor."" Parlor. God this place made Bones uncomfortable. The journey to said parlor did little to put but Bones"" mind at ease. Kirk and Pike were engaged in a conversation and talking animatedly, while he was left to brood about the consequences that would undoubtedly come when they reached the parlor and an entire police squadron was set up to arrest them. To his enormous relief, his fears remained unconfirmed as Pike swung the massive and unnecessarily fancy doors open and there was only a scattering of occupants, none of whom looked particularly intimidating or police-esque. ""Everyone this is James Kirk and Dr. Leonard McCoy. They-"" Before Pike could finish his sentence, a woman walked up to Kirk. Bones felt a sinking feeling as he recognized her chocolate skin and the long black hair pulled into a high ponytail on the top of her head. ""Uhura! It""s so good to see-"" Kirk was interrupted as a slap resonated through the room. ""I see you two have met,"" Pike commented drily, looking from the fuming woman to the man currently clutching his cheek. ""What-"" Once again Kirk was interrupted. ""That was for Gaila."" Uhura""s glare was terrifying. ""We run in some of the same circles,"" Bones leaned over and whispered to Pike. ""Ah."" The older man nodded in understanding. ""That""s not a surprise."" Uhura tore her murderous gaze from Kirk. With a flip of her ponytail she turned towards Bones and offered her hand. ""Dr. McCoy. It""s always a pleasure."" ""Likewise,"" Bones said, trying to keep from laughing. ""What, you don""t slap Bones?"" Kirk muttered, looking utterly offended ""Dr. McCoy didn""t sleep with my best friend and never call her again!"" Uhura shouted, once again whirling on Kirk. He shrunk back, afraid of her wrath, and this time Bones couldn""t stop the chuckle from escaping.",2943978
435,"It had taken copious amounts of pleading, begging and bribery to get Alya to agree to come with them to Chloe""s. If there was a set limit on best friend favors, Mari was sure she""d have maxed out for a month. ""I can handle Chloe. I know I can. I""ve done it before. I just need to remember that this is about making sure Chloe doesn""t mess with our guys, and Eli."" Alya smirked. ""So now Adrien is your guy?"" Mari blushed even deeper. ""It""s a work in progress..."" ""Bonjour, Marinette. What""s a work in progress?"" asked Adrien, just entering the class and taking his seat. ""Adrien! Good us- I mean, good morning, Adrien..."" Mari flustered. ""I was talking about... this outfit! It""s a work in progress. Just thought I""d test it out today..."" Adrien smiled. ""I think its cute."" ""M-merci, Adrien..."" Mari fidgeted in her seat as her best friend watched with a smirk. She dreamily watched him chat with Nino about the events of the modeling gig from yesterday. ""You totally wore that to look good for Adrien, didn""t you?"" Alya whispered conspiratorially. ""No!"" Mari whispered back. ""Just a little... But I did want to test it out. I really like the way the design of this skirt came out."" ""Hmm..."" her best friend wasn""t buying it. The rest of the day was full of compliments on her outfit, some from upperclassmen and others from the assistant art instructor Theo Barbeau. She was bubbling with happiness and euphoria, by the time math rolled around. Eli came late to school, but he had an excuse. He went to his seat in the back, near Nathanael. A few moments into class, Mari""s phone vibrated. She looked down to see it was a text from Eli. E: Like the outfit. The skirt would look better w/cardigan tho ;) Mari rolled her eyes and sent a quick reply. M: That""s a date look. This is a trip to the Brat""s Lair. Vest works for this. Mme. Mendeleiev chose that moment to reprimand Chloe for texting and Mari stealthily slipped her phone back into her bag. As Chloe argued that she was simply texting her driver to be ready after school. ""This is totally ridicule! Ridicule!"" Chloe pouted as Mendeleiev continued with her lesson, confiscating her phone. Adrien glanced over, not for the first time, at Mari as she gazed at Chloe""s room. It was pretty huge, fitting Mari""s room in it three times over. But I still prefer Mari""s room to this mausoleum, Adrien thought to himself, remembering the warmth of the Dupain-Cheng household. ""Mademoiselle Bourgeois, your snacks are here."" a maid said from the doorway. Chloe dismissed the older woman with a flick of her hand. ""Sabrina, bring the snacks over here. You are going to love this Eli-poo-"" Eli and the rest of the gang winced at the nickname. ""-I""ve got the best pastries in Paris. My chef is world-class."" Eli plucked a cream puff from the tray Sabrina wheeled in front of the quintet of friend and tossed it into his mouth without preamble. Adrien simply went with a fluffy looking croissant that was heavier than it looked. He tore off a piece and popped it in his mouth, only to find himself frowning. It tasted- ""Too sweet!""",3439302
868,"Lion-O saw that the other defenders all looked nervous and unsettled as they waited. Panthro was right - they needed a rousing speech. He just wasn""t so sure he should be the one to do it. But he gathered his courage and spoke loudly and clearly to those he may soon be dying with, ""Brothers and sisters in arms, you know that today we fight a great evil. It""s why we came together. Why we could put aside our many differences and grievances. I may not know you and after today I may never even have the chance. But still you are all my brothers, all my sisters, for the bond joined in battle is one that isn""t easily broken. And here, on this day, Mumm-Ra and his forces shall learn the price of trying to enslave this family!"" He raised his sword, wishing it were his real one. Lion-O finished to the sounds of echoing roars and cheers even as the enemy was mere moments away. Panthro looked torn between impressed and amused. ""I""ll never understand how you can deliver such a speech on the spur of the moment."" Lion-O smiled at the other cat, as the enemies"" ladders and hooks latched onto the walls, ""We all have our talents."" ""Let me show you some of mine."" Panthro cried as he lunged at the nearest foe. Lion-O followed suit. The battle raged and Lion-O felt both tired and exhilarated by the fighting. He would occasionally fight as a duo with Panthro and then feel Cheetara speeding by. He defended his comrades and defeated his enemies with precision and focus. And the wall did not fall. That was when Mumm-Ra arrived. Cheetara was the first to react, ""Tygra was so sure, Mumm-Ra would seek him out."" The guide whispered in Lion-O""s ear, ""You are the one to challenge the ""great"" Mumm-Ra. You embarrassed him the last time you met him in this world and defeated him in many others as well. We can do this, Lion-O."" Lion-O wondered about the we, but held his tongue. Together, the three ThunderCats charged Mumm-Ra, hoping that not giving him a clear target would allow them to slip past the transformed mummy""s defenses. It didn""t work. Panthro tried his luck and was tossed aside. Cheetara tried as well, and despite landing a few blows, she was taken out quickly as well. Lion-O was quick to rush to her side. She passed out in his arms. Furious, Lion-O took his own shot at Mumm-Ra, who chuckled, ""You really think you can defeat me?"" Lion-O was thrown to the ground, but it wasn""t long before he was up again. ""I don""t know, but I will try!"" Mumm-Ra threw his magic at Lion-O again; causing him to fall again and this time lose his sword over the edge of the wall. Mumm-Ra roared in amusement again, and Lion-O looked around desperately for a weapon, finding only a dagger with a broken hilt. How could he defeat Mumm-Ra, the ancient evil spirit, with only a broken knife? The guide watched him with a tilted head, as though she was curious and confused as a housecat. Lion-O would""ve growled at her if hadn""t been trying to starve off his own destruction, dodging another attack. She quipped, ""Must you relearn every lesson each week?"" He chanced a glare for that comment.",1497577

One of the other staff members asks the warden, ""Are you as mad as the inmates? This girl has done unspeakable things towards animals... how could you make such a decision?"" Then the other staff member takes off the hat and it""s revealed to be the shrunken head Heady Youngman and under him are two Manji Warriors. Three more Manji Warriors break through the window as they raise their spears at the staff, then a horde of zombies break down the door and Cajun Fox takes off his disguise and grabs Bellaluna as they go out the gate while she laughs maniacally. Bellaluna then says, ""Thanks boys, now to cause more chaos, MANJIS, OPEN THE CELLS!"" Then the Manji Warriors mess up the controls and then the cells open and the inmates run amok in the halls. Bellaluna then asks the inmates, ""Hey! Who here wants to escape with me? No Mr. Zsasz, you""re not allowed!"" Riddler then smiles widely at the offer and then a zombie gives Bellaluna her rabbit foot talisman and turns him into a tiny box covered in question marks and then she sees Scarecrow raising his arm and then she turns him into a tiny straw doll. I have room for one more, any volunteers? Then she sees Mr. Zero ask her, ""I""ll go with you young lady, I figure you might want an ""ice"" guy like me!"" Then she turns him into a tiny stuffed polar bear and hides her in her jacket along with Scarecrow and Riddler. Bellaluna then thinks to herself as she escapes, ""Now that I transformed my best friend the Joker, Scarecrow, Riddler, and Mr. Zero into tiny objects just to slip them undetected, I have my own big four! YES!"" Then she shouts as Heady is on her shoulder, ""look out dog, Bellaluna""s back in town and I""M NOT ALONE! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!""

155,"Downstairs, Kahoko couldn""t help but smile as she remembered Tsukimori-kun""s blushing face. After making sure he was out of sight, her smile had developed into a burst of giggles. The little incident was just too precious! Maybe, her day was going to be pleasant after all. Upstairs, Tsukimori was thinking the exact opposite. Kahoko pouted as she performed the warm-ups Tsukimori-kun ordered her to do. She had nothing against the warm-ups-- she knew they did wonders to her playing-- but what bothered her was that Tsukimori was deliberately making her repeat the routine over and over. It seemed pretty obvious that it was his way of getting back at her after the little episode about his state of unpreparedness. Tsumkimori, now had taken a bath and was neatly dressed, stood beside her, never taking his critical eye off her except for when she looked back at him. He would look away, his lips set in a thin line, as if thinking of something very repulsive. Kahoko guessed that he really was embarrassed to act that way. ""Tsukimori-kun, don""t you think---"" ""Repeat."" Kahoko forced herself not to grip the bow too hard. ""Tsukimori-kun, I""m getting really tired of--"" ""Repeat,"" he said flatly. ""Now, now, Len, don""t you think that warm-up is enough?"" Hamai Misa asked gently as she entered the music room, music sheet in hand. She gave Kahoko a warm smile, ""you""re getting bored, aren""t you Kahoko dear?"" The red-haired violinist nodded quickly as she flashed Tsukimori a pleading look. His brows furrowed, ""fine then."" ""Finally!"" Kahoko groaned as she stretched her shoulders. Tsukimori noticed her relax, ""we""re just getting started, Hino."" Kahoko nodded almost gloomily. Hamai Misa who was silently watching the two chuckled. ""Don""t worry, Kahoko dear. You won""t have any problem with the piece you are going to play for the director."" She waved the music sheet she was holding. ""Len said you""ve played this before."" Kahoko""s head snapped up in attention. ""Really?"" she asked, puzzled. ""I.. I don""t know many songs.."" She sent a questioning look at Tsukimori who huffed. ""It""s Chopin""s Etude no. 3, opus 10."" Seeing no flicker of recognition on the female violinist""s face, he sighed just as a slow melody resonated from the piano. Kahoko turned to Hamai Misa who was now sitting on the beautiful white piano, her eyes closed as her fingers moved delicately on the white and black keys. ""Hey.. that""s.."" ""It was your piece in the first selection,"" Tsukimori finished for her. Mesmerized by the music, Kahoko stood unmoving, her eyes closed as the music gained tempo, the notes growing louder in crescendo, and finally growing softer, slower, the last note resonating single-handedly. ""Wow..."" Kahoko released a breath she did not knew she was holding. ""That... was beautiful."" Hamai Misa smiled, ""thank you."" ""That piece sounds so beautiful with the piano,"" Kahoko commented softly, her eyes drifting to the golden violin she was holding. ""And yet the director prefers to hear it with the violin,"" Tsukimori noted almost disapprovingly. He eyed Kahoko.",560480

He tossed the covers aside, briefly shivering as he squirmed his way to the edge of the bed. ""Bring me that robe-it""s freezing in here."" She got a dark blue robe off the back of a chair and helped him get it on. When he was no longer shaking so much, she took his hands and placed them on her shoulders. Then, she put her hands on his sides. ""I""m going to back straight up,"" she warned him, ""which is going to pull you up. Even if you start to fall, don""t panic. I""ll be able to catch you this way."" He wrinkled his nose in disgust. It looked a little like they were about to start dancing, but if this was the only way, so be it. She pulled him upright and filled her promise of not letting him fall. It was awkward and hard-his feet were splayed apart the way a toddler""s would be and his knees were shaking. She helped him correct his posture. ""Now, when I move my foot back, you move yours forward, okay?"" What he ended up doing was more shuffling than walking. It was the first time most of his muscles had ever done any real work, so he tired out very quickly. They""d only made it from one end of the bed to the other and back before he had to stop and rest. ""Ow,"" he complained, ""I""ll be glad when it doesn""t hurt."" ""That goes away with practice, kind of like how I used to ache all over when I was climbing trees,"" Tohru confided in him, ""and I stopped falling out of them, too."" At the image of her falling on her butt in the grass, Akito chuckled darkly. ""I wish I could have seen it."" ""Did Okami say you could come outside tomorrow?"" Tohru asked. ""No, but she hasn""t said no either,"" Akito said, ""if I could just keep from getting sick again for a while, I could probably go out all the time."" He was panting from exertion now and it was harder to keep him upright. It wasn""t long before they had to call it quits and go to bed for real. Tohru smoothed his covers over him; Akito was already having trouble keeping his eyes open. She noticed the box that Isuzu had tried to take from him on the nightstand. ""Akito...what""s in that box?"" ""Nothing,"" he slurred, voice becoming heavy with sleep. ""Then why is it so important?"" ""Because."" ""Because?"" ""It just is. Like how your name is just Tohru."" She shrugged. ""Okay...good night, then."" The next morning, she woke to a great deal of chaos. Akito was clearly upset about something-she heard a lot of shouting followed by a very big crash. The heavy dark fog of sleep battled with the adrenaline being pumped into her veins. ""Kagura? What""s going on?"" she asked stupidly as Kagura all but exploded into the room. ""Akito won""t let us get near him,"" she sighed, ""I thought since you two were getting along so good that you could try to calm him down."" Tohru stumbled after Kagura, still not fully awake yet. By the time she saw Akito, she was.",870118
2925,"How could I not spot it right away? It is actually blaringly obvious. Like reading a Superman comic and wondering all the time why nobody ever recognizes Clark Kent the moment he shows his face in public. But people only see what they expect to see, and the last thing I expected, ever, was my Turtle friends somehow becoming human and showing up at my prom. In the early days, when I had just met them, and before they told me all of their story, I used to think that they, like Splinter, were mutated humans, not anthropomorphic animals. And of course I did wonder what they may have looked like as humans, but I""d always imagined them to look vaguely Japanese, at least to a degree, seeing as Sensei is Japanese as well. But now that I know that they never started out as humans, it makes more sense that they would blend in here. I must have moved forward again during all this thinking, for Mikey has spotted me. A delighted grin splits his face from ear to ear and he waves enthusiastically at me. I take a deep breath and pick my way towards them. Leo and Raph both look at me, raising their eyebrows in perfect unison in what I suppose is surprise at seeing me in anything other than jeans and a top. Raph gives me an appreciative nod and a curious half-smile, quirking one corner of his mouth. Leo just nods and smiles. Mikey elbows Donnie, who has been looking the other way until now. Donnie turns his head towards me slowly, as if he is mentally preparing for it. When his gaze finally alights on me, different emotions register on his face and flicker in his eyes in rapid succession. There is surprise, wonder, then something like awe, and finally something I can""t quite define. It makes me feel curiously self-conscious, and I tug on the waist and sleeves of my dress, making sure everything is still in place. Two girls who have been checking out Leo and Raph have obviously seen our long-distance exchange, for one of them-I don""t even know her name-grabs my arm. ""Hey, April, who""s that hottie over there?"" she asks in a dramatic whisper, pointing quite openly at Raph. ""Why have I never seen him here before?"" ""Because he""s never been here before,"" I reply smoothly. ""I know the guys, they""re, uh, friends from out of town. I didn""t know they were coming, either."" ""What""s the hot one called?"" the other girl wants to know. ""If you mean the one in the red tie, that""s Raph. And the one in the blue tie next to him is Leo. And now excuse me, I really have to say hi. I haven""t seen them in forever."" Which is actually meant in a more literal sense than any of the girls will ever know. I barge on, deliberately blending out the excited whispers behind me. Mikey pushes past his brothers, giddy with excitement. Before I know what""s happening, he has thrown both arms around my waist and hugs me, his head tucked just below my chin, like a little kid. Some of his enthusiasm rubs off on me, and I feel a grin spreading across my own face. I hug Mikey back and have to fight the sudden and irrational urge to plant a sisterly kiss on top of his unruly hair.",240213
2942,"Konichiwa! Firs of all, arigatou gozaimasu for all those who reviewed! You inspired me a lot. Thanks also for the corrections. I used them here in this chapter.Disclaimer: I don""t own Ayashi no Ceres. Only Yuu Watase owns it. How many times do I need to say that --Chapter 2 Ceres appears Since ancient times, people have adored the beauty of the sunset. The perfectly shaped orange sun was like a king with the red orange sky as his cape. Nothing could compare the feeling of calmness it brought about. It was just so perfect. It was something that could take away all your negative feelings such as sadness and emptiness. Who would have thought that in this occasion its power had no effect? In the gloomy chapel lit by those spooky candles, no one seemed to care about the sunset. No one bothered to look out in the window to experience the warmth the sunset held, to let it cheer him up and take his worries away. But of course, with the very heavy atmosphere the chapel possessed, who would have thought such things? The chapel was now almost deserted. People left long ago, maybe they can""t bear such atmosphere. Only those really close to the 2 deceased teenagers were left. ""Aya, you should really go home now. You need to get some rest, "" Suzumi sat beside the mother-to-be. ""I still don""t want to..."" Aya protested. She turned her gaze to Yuuhi who was lost in his thoughts. He was sitting beside Chidori""s coffin. Understanding what Aya was thinking, Suzumi patted Aya""s back, ""Don""t worry, he will survive this."" Aya noticed that she doubted what she said. ""And besides, you really need to get some rest. You really need energy because there is another life in you..."" Aya glanced over her belly. It was large due to the fact that she was 9 months pregnant. Suzumi is right. ""Maybe I really-"" Aya didn""t have the chance to finish what she was saying. Suddenly, the bond Yuuhi dropped earlier glowed so much that it became noticeable. ""What happened Toya?"" ""What is this?"" The celestial maiden""s symbol appeared a few feet in front of Yuuhi. A blinding flash forced them to block their eyes. Once it cleared, they were surprised to see the least person they expected. Ceres. ""Why are you here?"" Aya asked. ""I have come to fulfill my husband""s last wish,"" Ceres answered. She was holding something in her hands. ""The mana!"" Alexander pointed the thing Ceres was holding. ""Why are you holding the mana? I thought it already merged with you?"" Toya asked. ""This is the mana the C project created. This is the mana my husband has."" ""But why?"" ""His last wish was to bring happiness to you all. He may not change everything, but he wants to give you something."" ""And what is that?"" ""With the power of the mana, Toya, Aki and Chidori will live normally."" There was again that dead silence. They were trying to analyze what Ceres had said. It was really a hard thing, you know. Having Ceres appear suddenly then announce that Toya, Aki and Chidori will live normally was just so...pathetic. ""What did you say?"" They were all surprise when it was Yuuhi who spoke.",560480

Potty Mouth then shouts at them, ""YOU MOTHER FLUSHIN"" POOPING DOODY BRAINS! DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU FLUSHIN"" DID! YOU MADE OUR JOBS BORING WITHOUT THOSE BRATS TO MAKE IT INTERESTING!

But before anything can happen, the door explodes and Sector M, lead by Numbuh 4444 shows up and asks, ""Relax villains, we""re here for the ones who killed Sector V!"" Then the villains pointed at Mr. Boss, Mr. Wink, Mr. Fibb, Mr. Fizz, and Knightbrace. Mr. Fibb then asks Numbuh 4444, ""Ummm...

And so Numbuh 4444 and her operatives attack Chester while Mr. Boss, Mr. Wink, Mr. Fibb, Mr. Fizz, and Knightbrace make their escape.

765,"Suddenly, Grimble""s spirit faded away and Travis knew that he has spent his last day at St. Aggie""s and he""s gonna fly away and escape and never come back. Hope this is an interesting one! Please read and review! This is it! The battle we""ve all been waiting for! Chapter 10: Prepare for Battle The next day, all of the Guardians started sharpening their talon claws and their masks as they head for battle at St. Aggie""s. Travis was standing at the hollow, feeling a little anxious but confident that this is his first battle to go against Kludd and Nyra after some brutal memories after being at St. Aggie""s for a year and a half. He walks slowly and sees everyone prepping for war. ""You ready?"" Travis turned around and sees Soren, Twilight, Digger, Eglantine, Otulissa and Gylfie standing in front of them and Travis replied, ""As ready as I""ve ever been."" Ezylryb looks at Travis and said, ""You""re ready to fight, my boy."" ""I just hope I learned what I""ve trained for."" ""You will. Just trust your gizzard."" ""No matter what happens, we""re all in this together."" Soren said. Travis looked at Eglantine and asked, ""Won""t it be dangerous for her?"" Soren looked at Eglantine and said, ""My parents are gonna take care of her and they""re going along as well."" ""Are they really?"" ""Yes."" ""I""ll be fine, Travis. Really."" Eglantine said. Travis chuckled and said, ""I know you will."" Twilight looked at Travis and said, ""We are all gonna go against evil yet again! St. Aggie""s have got nothing on young Travis!"" Digger said, ""Don""t overdo it again."" ""Travis, I do hope that you""ll be fine."" Gylfie said. ""I""ve been saying the same thing to myself."" ""But I have confidence that this will be the most adventurous journey we""ve ever faced."" ""I know you and Soren have been to St. Aggie""s before and I""m sure it was horrible."" Travis said. ""The worst."" Soren said. ""Why didn""t Kludd leave?"" ""I don""t know why. I think I was the reason why."" ""Don""t blame yourself, Soren. He should""ve left with us."" Gylfie said. ""But he chose that path. I still don""t understand why he never left St. Aggie""s."" ""Me neither."" ""He might""ve stuck around."" Otulissa said. ""Might have."" ""So, I don""t know about you, but I am ready to put an end to this horrendous nightmare."" Travis said. ""Right you are! I think this calls for a song!"" Twilight exclaimed. ""Oh, please don""t. I can""t take listening to your songs."" Digger said. ""Well, you""re gonna hear it anyway."" ""The only importance is that we can make strong the weak and mend the broken."" Soren said. ""Wasn""t there a third thing?"" asked Travis. ""And to vanquish evil."" ""That too."" Boron came over and asked, ""Are we all ready for this battle?"" ""Yes, sir. We are."" Soren replied. ""I""ve got your talons ready."" One by one, everyone got their talons ready and Travis looked his talon claws and it feels like he""s ready for this. Seeing that this is his first time there, he""s ready for anything. Otulissa looked at Travis"" talons and said, ""You know, for your first battle, I think you look amazing."" ""Thanks, I think.""

1858,"Of course, his eyes were no longer on the ceiling, but on his self-professed French angel. His spinning stopped as Monique grabbed the chair and proceeded to have it facing her. Randy grinned again even though he knew it might only make the situation worse. ""I see you""re as radiant as always, mon cheri."" ""Do not even start. I am not in the mood."" Monique replied coldly, before grabbing a surprised Randy by the collar and lifting him out of her personal chair. Somewhat shaken, the hacker just smiled to himself, relishing the hard to get game that Monique was always playing. It never seemed to get old. ""Nice to see that everyone""s shown up, because we""ve got another possible mutation on our hands. I""ve been informed that there""s been some sort of creature attacking livestock in Arkansas. A local farmer says he""s even seen the creature with his own eyes."" Nick began, and as expected, he had easily gotten the rest of H.E.A.T""s attention. ""Another day, another mutation. I wonder what kind of nasty it""ll be this time."" Randy commented. ""Hopefully something nonviolent? At least towards people?"" Craven said, but all eyes turned on him and suddenly he felt very uncomfortable, ""Oh..never mind me. Of course that would be too good to be true..."" ""Violent or nonviolent, it does not matter. I will do what is necessary."" Monique stated as she stood up from her chair. Judging by the serious expression on her face and the fact that her fists were almost clenched, it seemed obvious that she was ready for anything. Randy couldn""t help but admire such a trait. ""We will do what is necessary. And that may or may not involve putting the creature out of commission."" Dr. Tatopoulos added. ""Not everything needs to be char-broiled, French Fry."" Elsie added. The French woman and the redhead seemed to have a momentary glaring match, which frightened Craven and amused Randy. Dr. Tatopoulos motioned the team to follow him. He didn""t want to make it obvious, but he was feeling very impatient today for some odd reason. He could only theorize in his mind that it must have been caused by Audrey-related stress. ""Let""s get going, people. This mutation isn""t going to take care of itself."" Nick announced, and as the members of H.E.A.T followed him out of the lab, N.I.G.E.L""s voice boomed behind them. ""LET""S DO THE TIME WARP AGAIN!"" ""Sometimes I wonder if giving N.I.G.E.L the ability to speak was a bad idea..."" Craven said as he shut off the lights to the lab and waited for N.I.G.E.L to come through the door after him. ""Looks like that animals sure must have had some party..."" Randy exclaimed, hoping to get a laugh and lift some tension from the current situation. Monique gave him an annoyed look, and he figured that was good enough. H.E.A.T had been surveying the damaged barn belonging to the Sullerman residence for the last few hours. The barn in question looked like it could have been hit with a wrecking ball, if that wrecking ball had also been capable of shredding through wood along with crushing it.",967934
3113,"Bruce rubbed his head. ""And they sent you rather than coming themselves?"" Dick shrugged again, ""Clark might stop by at some point, but frankly Bruce, most of them think you""re unstable on your best days and are at least slightly afraid of you."" The mention of people being afraid of him made Bruce flash back to the night before. He rubbed his temples harder. He didn""t need this right now. ""Dick I really don""t need company right now."" ""I beg to differ."" Dick leaned back, throwing his arm on the back of the chair. ""And judging from the state of your bed and Alfred mentioning Miss Kyle""s state of disarray, I highly doubt you were alone last night. It""s the only reason I waited until morning once I heard the news. I wanted to make sure you got some sleep."" Bruce gave him a death glare, but after being exposed to them so often over the years, Dick had built up an impressive immunity to them. His face grew serious, ""It wasn""t your fault. Jason made his own choices."" The fact that Dick was sounding like Selina made Bruce want to run away, just leave Gotham, if only for a moment. He thought about how every inch of the city had something to remind him of Jason, the boy he""d failed. Bruce""s mind stalled at the mere thought of it. God. He had to leave Gotham. Now that he had a plan, Bruce removed his hands from his head and said, ""I need to get out of Gotham."" He looked up at his former protégé, ""Would you like to come with?"" Dick was shocked. Not just by Bruce admitting he needed a vacation, but that he""d been asked to accompany him on said vacation. His answer was almost automatic. ""Sure."" Now that a plan was in place, something deep inside of Bruce settled. ""I""ll make the arrangements. I""m thinking Tokyo first."" Bruce threw his legs off the bed, but kept the sheets around his waist, looking at Dick expectantly. But Dick was still too deep in shock to pick up on the prompt. So Bruce said, ""Dick, I""m naked under this sheet, and need a shower. You""re in my way, and I doubt you want to stay."" Yeah, Dick definitely didn""t want to see anything under the sheet. He hastily removed himself. Selina loved Gotham. The city had a heartbeat and a feeling that was unique to any other place in the world. Its citizens were just as unique, for better or worse. It was her home in every sense of the word. God, she would miss it. Ted Grant returned from the bathroom, as soon as he sat again he looked at the key she""d pushed across the table to him once again. He picked up the conversation from where they""d left it. ""Now let me see if I""ve got this straight. You""re giving me the key to your paid for penthouse because you""re leaving Gotham."" Selina was slightly annoyed by his disbelief. ""I didn""t realize moving was such a difficult concept for you, Ted."" ""I don""t believe it."" He slapped his hand on the table, drawing the attention of some of the more cultured patrons, and Selina thought she should""ve picked a less upscale restaurant for this as she briefly scanned the crowd for familiar faces. ""I just don""t fucking believe it."" ""It""s happening whether you believe it or not.""",1497577
1830,"First time mothers normally feel fetal movement at 20 weeks (5 months) while those who already became pregnant before feel their baby move as early as 16 weeks (4 months). I""m just assuming that being ninjas, Sakura and Sasuke are more perceptive to these small movements. :D I miss Part 1 smiling Sasuke :( Whether it be in canon or filler. Thank you for reading and please do review! If you are reading this, thank you very much! Also, thank you to everyone who reviewed! Prompt 3: Phobia As someone born with a large forehead, Sakura strove to be inconspicuous. She tried covering her glaring forehead with her hair but it just served to make her stand out more and be the center of teasing as a young girl. Her pink hair was another aspect of her that made her too conspicuous. She had been afraid that she was an easily recognizable target to Rogue Ninjas. Becoming an expert Medical Ninja came with fame. People recognized her name and with it brought high expectations that she was somehow like a Kami-sama who could cure any disease. Being conspicuous scared her. Now, as Uchiha Sakura, she found that she had once again become conspicuous. People stopped, some even gawked openly, staring at the Uchiha symbol now embroidered at the back of her favorite red top. It was the same reaction at the hospital, at the market, and even now at Ichiraku""s where she had dinner with her teammates. ""Is there something wrong?"" she heard Sasuke ask quietly beside her. He was looking at her intently, reading her expression. Naruto was busy chattering about the ongoing construction of his stone monument (""Seriously, my head""s going to be the coolest! Believe it!"") while Kakashi was still engrossed with his reading, only half-listening, if listening at all. Sakura shook her head. ""Nothing."" It was pointless to let Sasuke worry about such a trivial thing. He did not look convinced but still he nodded. Sakura was left to her thoughts for a few moments until, ""Does it bother you?"" Head turning, she fixed Sasuke a questioning stare. ""What?"" ""People looking,"" he clarified with a quirk in his lips as his eyes flickered to the symbol on her back. ""I wouldn""t have expected it from you, considering your nature of work."" Was she really that readable? Sakura tilted her head, processing his words, and opted for a wry reply, ""You""re being awfully conversational today, Sasuke-kun."" ""Hn."" And he was back to monosyllabic responses. Sakura sighed and pillowed her chin against her palm. ""Maybe.."" She glanced at him, ""Don""t you?"" He closed his eyes, and shrugged as if the topic was of no concern to him. ""Let them stare. I am proud to be an Uchiha."" She couldn""t help the snort that escaped her lips. ""Arrogant little bastard."" It surprised her when he smirked haughtily, ""You should be too, Sakura, as you""re an Uchiha now."" The smirk that formed on her lips mimicked his as she scolded herself mentally for being easily scared. An Uchiha. She liked that. She took a sip of her drink. Let them stare then.

How much trouble could they have possibly gotten into?"" ""Too much."" Jason""s annoyance was quickly giving way to fear. This couldn""t be happening. They just lost Percy and Annabeth, there was no way he was letting everybody else down as well. ""We""ll just have to find them."" Leo looked at him, his cocked eyebrow betraying his doubts. ""No offense man, but that""s all we""ve been trying to do and in case you hadn""t noticed, it""s not going so well."" Jason sighed in irritation, but he knew that Leo was right. ""I know. I know. We need to come up with a plan."" Leo looked around nervously. ""Plans don""t exactly fall into my field of expertise,"" he pointed out, looking expectantly at Jason. Jason returned the stare, but didn""t answer, instead he looked thoughtfully at the demigod in front of him. Leo was continually selling himself short. Sure, he""d brag about his numerous accomplishments right after they happened, but as soon as someone like Jason, Annabeth, or Percy came into the picture, he""d immediately relinquish the leadership role to them. How could Leo say he wasn""t good with plans? Jason could easily remember tons of times Leo""s quick thinking had saved everyones"" butts. The instance with the Cyclops last year on Leo, Jason, and Piper""s first quest together. Leo had saved all their lives. Fat lot of good Jason had been then, unconscious and wrapped in chains. And even more recently, with Echo and Narcissus. Jason hadn""t actually been there, but again one of Leo""s crazy plans had saved the day. And yet, he was still unsure of himself. It seemed that with Annabeth and Percy lost, it was up to Jason to lead the quest. Unless Nico tried to take over, of course. It wasn""t that Jason was unsure in his ability to lead, he""d been a leader his entire life, he was confident in himself. Or he was. That changed slightly when he meant Percy. Percy just made it seem so easy to have people""s lives in his hands. He always seemed to make the right decision quickly and efficiently. He""d been named praetor of the Romans when he had barely spent a week with them. It made Jason feel just a little inadequate. By all accounts he should be better than Percy; even if Percy was older, Jason had known that he was a demigod for longer, had been training for longer, and of course, Percy""s father was Poseidon and Jason""s was Zeus.",2943978

She""s been assigned Jillian Gutzman as a ""buddy,"" and Jillian""s nose is so brown that Emma can smell the shit ten feet away. She squirms in her seat, a captive audience for the matinee performers. The only thing that""s cool is watching the actors get into the harnesses to ""fly"" on stage about fifteen feet off the ground. Everything else sucks. She""s confused as to why anyone would believe that the woman - there""s no mistaking the curve of her chest or hips when she stands at an angle - is a preteen boy. Later on her English teacher will force them to watch the old film starring Mary Martin in order to prepare their compare-and-contrast essays, and she""ll think it""s even more ridiculous that the tradition of the theater is to shove middle-aged women into Peter Pan""s tights. The story is boring, and she feels zero empathy for any of the cast. The Darlings are privileged brats, and Peter Pan is an idiot for wanting to be an orphan. Her disbelief doesn""t suspend, and she spends the rest of the time picking the play to bits in her head, even as Jillian makes the audience-appropriate reaction sounds like she""s reading stage cues from the script. Emma yawns as Tinker Bell saves Wendy, and can""t bring herself to care as Peter tries to save his fairy friend. The rest of the audience is clapping Tinker Bell back to life, but Emma doesn""t bother to lift her hands. This is stupid, she thinks. It""s just a light pointer and some bad sound effects.",1112924
115,"Keller stood his ground, he glared at Shillenger. ""Yep. I walked up to McManus""s office, I told him every single detail of what happened, I told him about me wanting to get sent to Oz. I told him I knew you from Lardner. I told him all about ""Operation Toby"". I told him how me, you and Metzger were all a part of breaking Beecher""s arms and legs."" Shillenger felt the anger rise up in his body and it took all the control in his body not to grab Keller by the throat and choke him to death while screaming ""you fucken idiot! Who did you think you were messing with?' ""Why? What in the world was going through your mind when you ratted on us?"" Keller opened his mouth to say something but suddenly turned his head as he saw Beecher walking down the stairs and then past them, as if it was nothing, Keller watched desperately as Beecher walked past the crowd slowly. ""Him!? You ratted on me for him?"" Keller turned his head to Shillenger, suddenly remembering he was still there. ""You don""t get it Vern. See the plan was for me to make Beecher fall in love with me, but the plan worked too well because I made Beecher fall in love with me but in return I fell for him"" Shillenger stood there in shock as Keller walked past him trying to go find out where Beecher was heading. *end of flashback* Shillenger grimaced as Keller brushed a few strands of Beecher""s hair out of his eyes, Shillenger turned on his heel deciding that he had took enough of that bullshit, he wasn""t going to just stand there and watch those two fondle each other or what the fuck ever they were doing. Shillenger exited the hospital and made it to EmCity and walked over to the cafeteria table and stared down at Robson. ""Robson"" Robson looked up from his lunch and hopped up and hugged Shillenger. ""You""re out of the hospital."" ""Same goes for you"" Robson moved and let Shillenger sit down, they stared at each other for a second. ""What""s the plan Vern?"" Shillenger turned his head and watched all the muslims gather in a circle as Said walked down the stairs and headed towards them. ""Operation Beecher, Keller and Said starts now"" Robson nodded and took a bite of his mashed potatoes. Said looked through the crowd of prisoners, so many different faces.... so many different colors; god why hadn""t he seen all the different colored faces? Kareem Said saw white, black, yellow, and various other colors and all he could think about was when he stabbed Shillenger the black and the white mixed with the dark red of the blood. He had plenty of time to think about a lot of things while he was in the hole and all he could think about was Tobias Beecher, what was it about Tobias Beecher that made him re-think every little thing he did ever since the minute he walked in OZ? Said had been happy where he was, he was leader of the muslims, he was in a very high place--- but then Tobias Beecher walked in the room and started asking questions, saying how he wanted God to love him and Said felt his heart reach out to him and then everything changed.",29783
1497,"Suddenly, people were leaving, and some even started running when they caught a glimpse of something from the one of the high rise window. Hungry beyond words and now quite annoyed as well, Sergeant Calhoun stood up and walked towards the window, with Felix just right behind her. ""Alright, alright, just what""s causing all this fuss?"" she asked loudly, only for Flo to appear right next to her, a worried expression on her face as she realized exactly what was going on. ""Oh dear. I knew there was a reason there were so many people in this game!"" ""What you mean?"" Felix asked, the rumbling only getting even louder as something huge shuddered the entire building with its bulk. ""I just opened my restaurant here. It seemed like a nice place to start a new business. But all this time I thought it was just an empty game!"" Flo practically yelled, as the rumbling threatened to drown out all other noise. ""Empty game? No game is empty! Where the heck are we, Felix?"" Sergeant Calhoun shouted, her tone of voice clearly showing her frustration. She got her answer though, when a massive hand, covered in brown fur, crashed through the wall of the building, reaching for whatever was within its grasp. It managed to latch onto the largest person within reach, which just so happened to be Sergeant Calhoun. As she struggled against its raw strength, and as Felix and Flo watched in terror, the creature truly revealed itself, climbing up into their view. What now held his dynamite gal hostage was the biggest gorilla Felix had ever seen. All Felix had to do was take on look at the bristling muscle hidden under his fur to know that Sergeant Calhoun wasn""t escaping any time soon. Still, that didn""t stop her from trying. ""Let go of me, you evolutionary has-been! Let go of me so I can fill that face of yours with all-you-can eat laser buffet!"" she threatened, though the gigantic monster simply ignored her, and in his grip she was unable to reach the spare gun that she had kept hidden in her dress this whole time. It was about this time that she was start to regret going with Felix to an unknown game without her armor and her rifle. Smiling through his massive canines as he looked at his new prize, George took one last look at Felix and Flo, before he continued his climb, with Sergeant Calhoun trapped in its unbreakable grip. ""No, no, no! That""s my date, you big monkey!"" Felix yelled in frustration, before turning back to Flo, who was still reeling in shock. ""You moved your restaurant into Rampage? What were you thinking?!"" he exclaimed, but Flo seemed to be in too much shock to give him much of a response. Clearly, she wouldn""t be much help. But as he turned around, he could see both Ulala and Beat, who besides himself and Flo, hadn""t run off in fear. ""Need some help? It""s been ages since we""ve been able to do something exciting."" Beat remarked. Ulala stood right by the skater, microphone in hand and her expression telling Felix that she was with him as well.",967934
3726,"She looked like she usually did and in a way she felt like she used to do, it was like she was getting in touch with this part of her she had long forgotten, a part of her she pushed away when she got together with Pacey, a part of her that belonged to Dawson. It was funny, she had slept the best she had for months and ironically it was in Dawson""s arms. He had held her all night, making sure she was safe and then he left early in the morning, leaving a short letter behind. Dear Jo- I had to go home, I wish I could of stayed until you woke up, but I really had to get home before my mom and dad started calling everybody, you know how they are. I know things have gotten so complicated so fast but I promise you, we will get through this and we will get through this together. It takes two to tango. I know stupid, but for some reason it sums up things pretty well. Well I am going to go home, get dressed and then go to school, see you there. -Dawson P.S. Jo no matter what kind of things life throws at you, I will always be here. Joey let her brown eyes scan through the hallway searching for Dawson, she pushed her way through the crowd of teenagers busily chatting about various things, none which really interested her, she just really wanted to see Dawson. Joey stopped searching when she saw the familar blonde haired boy at his locker, Joey smiled and walked over to the locker and leaned against the one right next to it. ""Hi"" Dawson looked up from his locker to see Joey, he smiled. She looked better, her eyes were no longer puffy and red and she seemed better; she was actually smiling and he thought he saw some sort of twinkle in her eyes, but he could of been mistaken. ""Hi Jo. Sorry about leaving..."" ""I got the letter Dawson, I just want to say thank you for being there for me"" Dawson smiled and shut his locker and turned to Joey, their eyes connected and for that second, it was like it was just them in the world, just like old times. ""Have you talked or seen Pacey yet?"" Joey shook her head and grunted something under her breath causing Dawson to look up, he smiled and waved at Jen who was making her way over to them. ""Be nice Joey"" Joey hit Dawson on the shoulder playfully and waved at Jen once she walked up to them. ""Hey Joey, Dawson. You guy seem awfully cozy"" Jen smiled, showing that she was only playing around. Jen looked at Dawson and then to Joey and saw something between them. ""Where""s Pacey?"" Joey felt her throat dry up at Jen""s question. ""I wouldn""t know he dumped me"" Joey hefted her backpack on her left shoulder and turned to Dawson before leaving. ""Meet you at lunch?"" Dawson nodded, she smiled and walked off to history class. Dawson watched her leave, his eyes watching her for the longest time, they only advanced to Jen once she cleared her throat loudly. ""He dumped her? Why?"" Dawson put his backpack on and bit his bottom lip not knowing how to really describe the whole situation Jen, it was the kind of situation where you had to be there to understand it. ""It""s complicated"" With those two words Dawson walked off towards English class.",29783

This is the second chapter of a prequel so This Story takes place days before the day Grim met the Eds...and it explains why Eddy hates demons and making deal with demons. Also this story may be dark but hey, anything to get your attention! I just got a E-mail about the name of the demon, he is nameless but he resembles 4KIDS president Alfred E. Khan, the most evil man in all of anime. So if the demon has a name, the name is ""That jerk who ruined ""One Piece"" and ""Shaman King""!"" ""Due to my strong personal convictions, I wish to stress that this fanfic in no way endorses Satanism."" -Neowinterknight- (yes, this is a parody of the disclaimer from ""Michael Jackson""s Thriller"") I hope no one notices I reused Hell jokes from my past fanfics but I really want Eddy""s hell to be so scary and surreal, it will make ""SUPERJAIL"" look like Kindergarden... ENJOY! Last Time: In the days that took place before the Eds met Grim, Eddy does the unthinkable and he makes a deal with a demon who strangly resembles Alfred E. Khan, chairman of 4KIDS (he""s just plain evil... ok?) so Eddy ends up with the midas touch, a power that turns anything the user touches into gold but Eddy got too much he can handle when his clothes turn to gold, his food, drink, and jawbreakers turn to gold...and kids into gold. He accidentally turned Nazz into gold (except for Sarah, Plank, and the Kankers... they deserved that!) but when Eddy""s run ran out, the demon came back to claim his soul and those he turned into gold. Double D stood up to the demon and arranged a trial that could save Eddy and the others from a face worse than death and break-up. As Double D is studying law while trying to save Eddy and Ed goof off with the golden statues and attempting to make out with the golden Nazz statue while watching ""Creepshow"", Eddy is having a...HFIL of a time! Note that since the demon thinks he""s Alfred E. Khan he even censored the name of his own domain into ""Home For Infinite Losers"".

892,"""Oh, but I have dabbled in acting, my dear,"" Enri said. Carlotta giggled again. ""Now I know why Erik hates her,' Celeste thought as she turned to go back to rehearsal. But Fetine saw her black mane as she did, and called out, ""Oh Seniora Diamond, come back!"" Celeste winced. She turned back around and slowly walked up to Fetine, Enri, Carlotta, and her entourage. ""Seniora Gudicelli,"" Fetine said, waving his hand behind him to make Celeste hurry, ""May I present a rising star in our humble theatre: Seniora Diamond Hitoshima."" ""That""s a stage-a name if ever I-a heard eet,"" Carlotta said, looking at Celeste as if she were dog droppings she""d racked off her shoes. Fetine coughed, and stammered, ""W- well, even so, she is a marvel. Not even twenty-one years old and she already has a talent that equals Senior Gaucinii."" ""That""s a tad overstating things, isn""t it?"" Enri said, huffing. ""I do, after all, have far more experience and have worked harder than she ever has!"" ""Pardon me, Senior, I didn""t mean-"" ""Then you shouldn""t have spoken!"" Carlotta spat, ""This man has obviously more talent-a than this... Foreign girl."" she turned to Enri, gave him a charming ( not really) smile and gushed, ""Enri, would you honor me and-a show me to-a my dressing room?"" ""Of course, oh magnificent Diva,"" he said, offering his arm and guiding into the building. ""Well..."" Fetine said, twiddling his thumbs, ""That went well."" The sad thing was he sounded like he really believed it. Break Erik rapped his baton on the table yet again. ""No, no, NO!"" he shouted, frustrated. He pinched the bridge of his nose, the he looked at Celeste and asked, ""Why are you missing every note?"" ""I""m sorry!"" Celeste shouted, gesturing in the air with her bow. ""I""m still mad at that... that... That ostrich and that penguin!"" she had told him about the meeting. This did not bode well. ""Block them from your thoughts,"" he said, trying to sound patient. ""If you desire to make beautiful music, you must push everything else form your mind- forget the world exists! Focus on the music- become the notes; be the score."" he raised the baton again and she raised her bow, he took a deep breath, getting ready to sing ""Se ben rammentomi"", again. Celeste dropped her arm and declared, ""It just makes me want to scream!"" Erik fell forward, put his elbows on the table, his head in his hands, and sigh with exasperation. ""I know, I know. I""m sorry,"" Celeste said, positioning her violin and bow again, ""Here, I""m ready to play now."" ""Forget it,"" Erik said, standing up and pacing, ""You""re of no mind to play tonight. If you let these morons get away with distracting you then you should burn that thing, and leave now, for they will have won."" ""I""m not quitting because a peacock and a pig think I""m a talking turd,"" Celeste said. ""Language, Madam,"" Erik said. He hated that she still spoke that way, even if it was only in private. ""Or have those lessons been for nothing, as well?"" ""To Hell with your lessons!"" Celeste shouted. She leaped up and stomped to her bed and threw herself on it.",512464
3461,"For all his flamboyant and un-spy like ways Revolver Ocelot knew perfectly how to be where the bullets weren""t. Ducking behind cover and popping out again, Ocelot pulled back the hammer with his thumb and fired. Unconsciously, the Russian clenched his right hand. Ever since he""d had his arm reattached after it""d been cut off the darn thing didn""t feel like it used to; hence the old man""s reason for shooting with his left hand. Jasper felt numb as something like a freight train hit him .All the strength left his legs and the Texan hit the floor. His hearing left him and time seemed to slow down. The only thing that seemed real was the feel of Edward""s hand holding his and the blood that was running down the gunshot wound he""d taken. Edward screamed and begged for Jasper to come along. It was then that Jasper was truly afraid and then that he made the hardest choice he""d ever made. The sound of Edward firing his gun back at Ocelot made Jasper flinch, breaking him out of his small bubble of time and space. With iron hands, he grabbed Edward by the shirt and whispered to him, ""Leave me."" Edward screamed. Edward cried and begged like a bum for Jasper to come with him but Jasper just set his mouth into a hard expression and punched Edward in the face. Edward fell back, bleeding slightly from the mouth. He turned around, aware of a gunshot wound that would have hit him if Jasper hadn""t have punched him in the face and knocked him down. Jasper looked at Edward with a face that was a twisted theatre mask of grief and emotional agony. ""Please,"" he said in a small voice, ""Save yourself, for me."" The world is a scary place and Jasper and Edward had never felt so helpless and small; and that was saying something since two years ago a crazy Scottish madman had tried to put Jasper through a wood chipper. And Edward fled, because he was afraid; but most of all he was afraid because Jasper was afraid and that scared him more than death. As Jasper bled and bled, a second gunshot hit him and knocked him to the ground like a kick. As he tried to crawl forward, he heard the sound of cowboy boots and spurs walking towards him. Without warning his field of vision was suddenly filled with Revolver Ocelot""s devilishly handsome visage. It hurt Jasper almost as badly as a gunshot how handsome Ocelot was. His moustache was waxed to perfection and glinted in the light. His silver hair was long and thick as a twenty year old""s. His hawkish features spoke of wisdom and hardness; the man had steel in his soul. The man also had poison in his heart; lurking inside that handsome Russian form was a hideous monster who delighted in rape and torture and betrayed his allies at the drop of a hat. Grinning like the devil, Ocelot patted Jasper on the cheek and positively oozed glee. ""Don""t go anywhere, princess; I""ve got to deal with your wife first."" Then the old man was gone by the tell-tale sign of his well-worn high quality cowboy boots. It took Jasper no time at all to realize what he""d done.",1220273
3021,"The man bowed in apology. ""Iie. It""s okay. I""ve gotten more hits much worse than this..."" Haru laughed, trying to lighten the mood. ""That""s good. Oh, by the way, kimi wa Ryuujin Let.""

Let slowly walked away, leaving Haru smiling. ""Arigatou, Let-san..."" Haru ruefully rubbed his temple, smiling at him. Room 2-B. English... Haru managed to arrive just a few minutes before the session started. The classroom did not seem overcrowded at that moment, and Haru could spot Julius at the back. Julius managed a grin at him, before turning his attention to a certain blue-haired boy. Haru turned back, patiently waited for their instructor to arrive. Meep meep Haru managed to look up to his hair, to see a weird looking ""dog-thing"". In a few moments, he saw a brunette scooting on the floor like she had lost something. ""Anou...kore...inu desu..."" Haru pointed at his head. ""HAAH!!! Plue-chan! How did you get there?!?! Arigato, ni-san..."" The girl bowed furiously and took the ""dog"" from Haru""s hair. ""Sou ka...inu desu?!?!"" Haru thought it was a ridiculously weird ""dog"", having no very, very short white fur, a humongous round head, and an ice cream cone for a nose. ""Actually, I don""t know...but he does look like a dog doesn""t it? And Plue looks absolutely kawaii!"" The girl hugged ""Plue"", almost as if strangling it to death. ""He he he...kateni hozaiteru..."" Haru sweatdropped at her, laughing tensely. The he shook up, forgetting his manners. ""Atashi Haru Glory desu."" Haru gave a hand to her, to which she accepted, holding ""Plue"" at the other hand. ""Kimi wa?"" ""Elie. Elie desu. Although the nihonjin keep insisting that my name is ""Erie"", I""m comfortable with both of them."" ""Huh? You""re not Japanese?"" Haru asked her, raising an eye. ""Watashi?

But actually, I""m Symphonian, although I don""t belong in the main continent."" Haru explained to her, his depression over his homesickness suddenly disappearing at recounting Gallage and Symphonia. ""Sugoi! I wanna go see Gallage sometime...""Elie jiggled, excited at the prospect of visiting a new place. ""Well, we could go there when vacation starts..."" Haru gave an assuring smile, to which Elie gave one of her squinty-eyed nods. ""Ohayou gozaimasu, minna..."" Everyone settled down as the middle-aged instructor arrived, setting her things down on to the teacher""s table. ""Ohayou gozaimasu, sensei!""",583064
2453,"This was the first case a cleric would counter the decision of an applicant for priesthood. ""But why?"" Byakko asked, fearing what she might have observed in him. ""You bear the aura of an evil monster, the blood that runs in you is inhuman, and you bear the pagan markings of corruption. Yet you choose to be an acolyte..."" Mathilda gave out her observations. ""It is my choice, ""Mother""... for me to want this job. I only want what my heart would tell me to do..."" Byakko gave her an answer of sarcasm. ""And you are right...so I bid you farewell. I trust we will meet again..."" The old cleric smiled bidding a confused novice farewell. Going back to the city of Morroc, Byakko didn""t believe that this was a city at all. It looked more like a settlement, the buildings were rundown, tents arrayed the city streets, and people would have preferred camping out rather than staying in inns. ""Ei, Byakko!"" Kuro called from the crowd. Byakko looked back to hear what the other boy wanted to say. ""How was your test?"" Kuro asked him. ""It""s finished. All I have to do is go back to the Sanctuary to accept my uniforms and receive training to use my skills."" ""That""s good...I still have to go below the Pyramids to take the test...but I""m damned to terrified to go down there..."" ""And why is that?"" ""They say there are certain bats that roam the first level of the area, mobbing unsuspecting people. And once in a while, a monster they call ""Mimic"" appears."" ""Y""know. It wouldn""t help if you stayed here rather than take your quest."" Byakko started to walk away. ""Hey, where are you going?"" Kuro called out. ""Home...I have to finish this quest today. I scheduled myself tomorrow to intensive training."" ""Is this a goodbye?"" Byakko looked back at the pony-tailed kid as he saw sadness, even if it was little, in his eyes. ""No. It""s a ""see you again""."" Byakko forced a weak grin, walking away as Kuro waved goodbye to him for the last time. Another long walk across the desert. Byakko had his fill of Condor wings, boiled Peco Peco eggs and Picky stew (he only ate the last dish when he was desperately hungry). Desert cuisine was not his style. He had to go back to civilization! After asking a few knights and thieves he had passed his way (and a hefty bribe to boot), Byakko finally got his bearings back and reached Prontera in the afternoon. First stop: The Flower Lady. She was the only ""nice, polite character"" (NPC he he...) that was really nice to him. Other characters would raise the prices of their wares when he would arrive and charge him low for the loot he is trying to sell, but she was the only npc that was fair and just to her. ""Good afternoon, ne-chan..."" Byakko greeted the Flower Lady. ""Oh, it""s you Byakko! Long time no see...how are you?"" She greeted back. ""Just fine, just fine. I""ve got loots from Morroc you may want to buy..."" ""You came from Morroc? That""s good! I hope you have a stock of feathers, I really need them for my special float on the Flora festival..."" She sneakily said, leering her eyes and bringing herself closer to the young boy. ""Uh...right...here.",583064
1277,"He tried looking at Zeke again, only to be faced with worried eyes from the silver organoid. Shadow saw the scar of the gash that he gave to Zeke. It must have hurt... Without looking at him, Shadow bowed his head in shame and grunted at Zeke. Organoid sub-titles activate ""Raargh...ragoompah rhurrhmmm....""

Shadow heaved a sigh of relief and joy. He finally got back someone he cared for and cared for him... Raven walked over the two and smiled a warm smile on to Shadow. ""Congratulations, Shadow...I""m happy for you..."" Raven whispered, brushing the spikes on Shadow""s back. Shadow immediately jolted up, remembering the duo""s predicament. He slowly explained to Zeke why the two had come here, and why Van was reacting very much weird, as what Zeke might have heard on the news, and last time on the inn where they spent their morning coffee. Zeke just placed his foreleg on to his jaw and began absorbing all the facts that Shadow can offer. Zeke, in return, drew a complex map on ground showing the group the exact coordinates and passages to where they can initiate the plan. Van just remained sleeping in the cockpit however. ""Rarrrgh rahhhh, Roouumph errraaarrhhh..."" Shadow made a small comment with a few grunts and groans that came from his throat. ""Thanks Zeke, we couldn""t have done it without you..."" ""Rrrrrgh, raaagh rooummph...."" Zeke replied, turning his back as he began to walk away. ""It""s nothing, I guess I""ll see you later..."" ""Raaaagh...ragoompah..."" Shadow ran a short distance to say his goodbye to Zeke, who left running leaving a small cloud of dust in his wake. ""See you...later..."" Raven began setting up camp as he carefully camouflaged it with the yellow tarpaulin he stashed away in his Geno Breaker. The girls meanwhile were busying themselves with cooking and preparing the basic needs while out in the desert. At least there was some use bringing them, Raven let a small smile run through his face. Going back to his Geno Breaker, Raven checked to see if Van had already awoken from his short nap. It seemed that the boy had always felt tired when there was some spare time to kill.",583064
527,"Mary had even smiled at her as she passed, and Lyanna had stared back, dumbfounded. She just doesn""t know who I am, she reasoned. That""s all. But she wanted to be friends. Lyanna had seen how Mary laughed and talked with her ladies-in-waiting, and she wished that she could be one of them. Life at the French court was a strange transition from her previous life. Before, she would wake at five, start the fire, and begin cooking breakfast. Her father would grab a piece of bread on the way out to the King""s palace, while her siblings squabbled over everything else. Then, her and her brother Finn would ride out to the fields and tend to them as needed. There was no time and no need for her to learn sewing, as she had done here. But that was the thing. Time. She""d never been used to having so much of it. These days she would wake at five and start to pull on her shoes before she realized that there was no breakfast to make, no siblings to cook for. After morning sewing she had the rest of the day to herself, and she never knew what to do with herself. The closest thing she had to a friend was Gracelyn, but she wasn""t exactly the type that Lyanna would spill all her feelings to. Gracelyn was nice to speak to during embroidery, but otherwise they never saw each other. Lyanna supposed the next closest she could call a friend was Francis, but even he seemed distant with her. Everyone was. Except for the bastard son. That first night when he""d grabbed her arm, Lyanna thought for sure he was just a drunk who wanted to bed her. But when she looked at him, she saw light green eyes that were full of concern in the candlelight. And he""d said those words to her, the words that almost sounded like a promise. But like all promises, she thought as she drifted off, this one is sure to be empty. A branch cracked. Lyanna sat up and hit her head on a low hanging branch. She groaned and clutched at the spot, which was now positively throbbing. She looked around and almost screamed; for the second time in a week, Sebastian had appeared seemingly out of nowhere. He stood in a patch of sunlight, the rays bouncing off his dark hair. ""Oh, it""s just you,"" she said to him, catching her breath. ""Stop scaring me like that, it""s enough to give anyone a heart attack."" Her tone was light, but darkness had clouded his eyes. ""You shouldn""t be here,"" he whispered hoarsely. ""What-?"" ""You shouldn""t be here!"" he repeated, pulling her to her feet. When he removed his hands from hers, her blood was stained on his palm; Lyanna couldn""t be certain, but it looked as though he had paled. ""Leave,"" he told her. ""Before it gets dark. Go! Hurry! I""ll distract them if I can,"" he told her, drawing his dagger. ""Bash, who-?"" At these words a dark shadow moved in the corner of her eye, and she gasped. ""They""re drawn by the blood,"" he said. ""Your blood."" She watched as he held the blade to his hand, slicing into his flesh. Drops of blood oozed out and splattered onto the dirt, tainting it a dirty scarlet. ""What are you still doing here?! Get out of here, now!"" ""I""m not going to just leave you here-!""",2855986
523,"She knew she should be grateful to the king and queen for treating her with such kindness, and she was- it was just no one else was. As she followed the Queen""s ladies through the corridors to get to the Queen""s Tower, all she could see were hands cupped around mouths as they whispered, smirks leering at her in the morning sunlight. When they had sat down they had all blubbered over her like she was a newborn child: ""Oh, Lyanna, you poor dear, let us show you the way the French sew."" ""I don""t know what they teach you in England, but surely it can""t be the same as our way."" ""Can you measure? I""ll measure your thread if you like."" They all thought her some kind of ill-bred savage, as a lower-classed idiot servant girl. But she set her jaw and refused all their offers. They peppered her with phrases like, ""Are you sure? I really don""t mind,"" their voices going an octave higher on the emphasized words, but by then she was already deliberately bent over her cushion, determined to show them that she could sew just as well as any of them. ""Oh, dear me, Lyanna... what have you been thinking to let your cushion become so... tangled?"" She looked up to see Katlyn, the eldest daughter of one of the queen""s cousins. She seemed to be the ringleader of the court ladies and always seemed to have a little sneer reserved just for Lyanna. ""Not of court gossip, surely,"" Lyanna replied. Katlyn""s lip curled. ""Be mindful of your tongue, Davenshaw,"" she hissed. ""Or you will be sent straight back to England in disgrace."" ""My family is already disgraced, Lady Katlyn,"" she said curtly. ""Perhaps your gossip is not up to date."" Katlyn""s face flushed scarlet, and she was about to answer when another voice rose up above the others. ""Oh, bother, I""m out of thread."" Lyanna, happy for a chance to go, leapt to her feet. ""I""ll go fetch some more."" She smiled at the woman who had spoken, whose name was Karen, or Sharyn, or something along those lines. She returned her smile. ""Thank you, my dear. I believe Nostradamus- our court physician- has the key to the linen storage. Tell him Lady Gracelyn has sent you for it."" Gracelyn, that was her name. A very southern name in Lyanna""s opinion, but she seemed kind. Lyanna laid down her sorry excuse of embroidery on her chair and paused long enough to curtsy in front of Catherine, who nodded in absentminded permission for the girl to leave. ""Thank you, your grace,"" she said, dropping another curtsy and hurrying across the wooden floor as quickly as she could while taking the approved, ladylike steps. Her steps had never been very long to begin with, especially compared to the great lengths her brothers could cover, but now she was supposed to go even more slowly. A lady must not walk, but glide, the ladies had told her on her way to the tower. Do not move your arms at your sides- simply hold them in place, and glide. For heaven""s sake, she was a human, not a swan. People walked. People even occasionally ran. But not ladies. Never ladies. Once she was out the door she returned to her normal pace, swinging her arms as much as she pleased.",2855986
1133,"He hoped she showed soon, but with his natural bad luck, he was bound to jinx it. Chat found his akuma surrounded by zombified victims of what he believed to be the cumin fog. There were wait-staff from the restaurant, bellhops from all floors, and the front desk clerk from the first floor. Most importantly, there were lots of cooks and chefs in the mix. In the thick of it was a deviously smiling chef. In lieu of Colette smart light brown chignon, Calamity""s hair was in twin stubby tails of bright orange. A chef""s hat was perched in between on her head like a outfit was a mix of drill sergeant and chef Barbie- a hot pink chef""s coat over an olive drab patterned dress, with hot pink boots to complete the look. A criss-crossed belt of spice-jars and cooking utensils- thankfully, no knives- hugged her chest and she held a cheese stained ladle over a holster on her waist. ""Yes, you all love my cooking, no! Chef Calamity is the greatest!"" She cheered for herself amidst the zombified staff and patrons. ""And no one can stop me!"" Chat chose that moment to jump in. ""Table, party of crazy?"" He muffling of the mask made the pun barely audible. ""No wait, wait- I""ve got a better one: did someone order a butt-kicking platter?"" ""Get him! And bring me his Miraculous!"" she ordered as the eerie violet outline-mask of Hawkmoth glowed over her own hot pink one. The zombies, as one, moved as one after Chat as he led them away from Calamity. ""You guys really like to dine-and-dash."" he called over his shoulder at the zombified chasers. His ring gave a resounding beep as he rounded the corner, transforming back to Adrien. ""Crap, crap, crap..."" he muttered as he shoved an exhausted Plagg back into his shirt pocket. If he could make it to the kitchen... The zombies rounded the corner and Adrien tensed. Now what? He thought this as he readied himself to fence through the crowd with a discarded mop. ""Adrien, duck!"" a familiar voice called. He obeyed and a curtain of white fell over the first few in the crowd. And then another one over the dozen or so behind them. It went on for a moment before Sheets, he swung overhead dropping sheet. Crazily, it worked. The zombies groaned and moaned, but they couldn""t get out of the freshly laundered trap. Ladybug landed in front of him. ""A-adrien, are you okay?"" she asked. Adrien nodded, feeling heat creep up his cheeks. ""C-ca va, mais... Ladybug, there""s still cumin in the air. Take this."" he handed her the mask he""d rummaged up for her as Chat. ""Merci, Adrien."" She took it almost reverently. ""But wait. Why are you here?"" ""I, uh, came looking for a friend of mine, Marinette. She ran after the lady who was akuma-tized. Colette."" ""I-I see..."" She looked a bit happy but pained when he told her this. ""Let""s get you to safety. An then I""ll go secure your other friends."" He frowned. ""How did you know I had other friends here?"" Was his lady psychic and not telling him? ""I-I heard from Marinette. After I saved her from the elevator Chat put her in."" She looked pissed at that.",3439302
2438,"""Not like that,"" he corrected with a smile of amusement, before showing Kasahara how caviar was meant to be enjoyed. His touch lingered just a bit too long on the boy""s wrist, but the boy didn""t pull away. Meiko managed to contain her frown until she got back to the kitchen, having to admit that Nanako was probably right. She had never gotten into boy-love manga, mainly because her older sister had been such an otaku about it. Any kind of PDA was embarrassing, really, but seeing two gorgeous men taken by each other (and did her mind really have to think ""taken"" instead of something more innocuous, like ""dating?"") made her grumpy. Nanako couldn""t stop snickering as she winked at Meiko. ""So?"" she said. Meiko grabbed a nearby linen off the counter and threw it at her friend. It was another couple that caught her attention about two weeks later, a man and a woman again, but very different from the businessman and his mistress. The woman was the one who caught her attention, dressed in a brilliantly red, low-cut blouse that showed off the curve of her breasts. She had long, equally red hair, and her lips were painted a shade of crimson that reminded Meiko of blood. She had hitched her chair around the table so she was sitting next to her companion, running a red-nailed hand over his lower arm. The man was a handsome blond, but he didn""t look like he belonged with the vamp. He sat with a slouch in his shoulders, and his thick, horned-rim glasses obscured his eyes. He was blushing heavily, like he wasn""t used to having a beautiful woman so close to him. All in all, he looked like a geek from one of the technical companies. This was a mismatch of the worst kind, Meiko couldn""t help but think. The woman was going to eat the poor man alive. ""Hello, how are you two this evening?"" Meiko greeted pleasantly. ""Very good,"" the woman drawled, speaking for the both of them ""Do you mind if I order for us, darling?"" Her voice, unexpectedly sweet, was in contrast to the rest of her appearance. ""G-go ahead,"" the man replied, with a hint of a stammer. ""Order whatever you""d like."" ""A bottle of red zinfandel, the best you have,"" the woman said. ""And whatever course your chef recommends to accompany it."" Pricey, Meiko couldn""t help thinking, and predictable. ""Any allergies?"" Meiko asked carefully. ""We can eat anything, as long as it""s well-made,"" the woman replied. ""Isn""t that right, darling?"" ""Darling"" squeaked an affirmative. Meiko wondered if the woman thought she was doing a good job hiding where her hand was. She pasted a pleasant smile on her face, agreeing to bring out something wonderful. When she got into the kitchen, she couldn""t keep from bursting into gales of laughter. ""What""s so amusing?"" Nanako wanted to know as she balanced a tray of dirty dishes. ""It""s nice to see a lady with a man so thoroughly twisted around her... little finger,"" Meiko replied. ""Though I do wonder how much of her attraction is to his bank account."" ""You mean the blond and redhead I saw Akari seat in your section a couple minutes ago?"" ""Yes,"" Meiko said, unable to suppress a snicker.",1112924

3223,"Alucard did not look up from the papers he was signing. ""That is not what I asked nor the answer I wanted."" ""Master, Natalie and her family were already dead by the time your assassins got them."" Alucard looked up. The glasses on his face magnified his eyes far beyond their true size. ""What did you say?"" Seras hid her fear, pretending to be as unflappable as the Captain. ""The Romanovs were murdered by an unknown assailant and evidence is inconclusive."" ""Who was it?"" he demanded, ""Who has saved the bitch Natalie from my wrath? Seras shook with fear at her master and handed him the reports from the scene of the crime. Glaring and growing angrier by the minute, Alucard scanned the police reports as well as the summaries by his sorcerers and scientists. ""NOTHING!"" he roared and threw the papers aside. It wasn""t like him to lose control outside of his free time mentality. ""Useless bureaucracy!"" He made as if to strike Seras but he stopped. Seras recoiled, afraid of being struck as well as afraid of being punished for dodging a strike. In Alucard""s mind, the wheels were turning and a plan was being churned out from his corrupt brain. And to the great surprise of Seras Victoria, he began to laugh. The madman was laughing unrestrained. He laughed the laughter of a killer; a laugh full of blood and joy. On his own he""d seen what his investigators had now. He had an epiphany. ""They were picking a fight with me!"" he shouted gleefully, throwing his hands in the air as if conducting an invisible orchestra. He saw the confusion on his secretary""s face and he explained as he dragged her over his desk and pulled her into a hug. ""Oh happy woman,"" he gushed, ""Someone has killed the Romanov family in order to make me blame the Vatican. The Romanovs were loved by both rebels and loyalists and their death will drive either side into a fury! HA-HAH!"" He threw Seras to the ground, fully lost in the new role he was playing. ""The Iscariots use silver bullets and the Hellsings use wood stakes and anything they can to slay the undead. The instrument of murder was foreign to either side. It cannot have been the Hellsings for they stay together and had to be in Sophia to kill Bartolome."" Alucard began to madly pace the room, a conqueror lost in the frenzy of the upcoming campaign. ""For this incident, I shall accuse the Vatican. Then, I shall covertly kill a few more vampires who advocated peace like the Romanovs. Their deaths I shall blame on Hellsing while my bounty hunters attack rebel leaders using the trademark weapons of the Hellsing Organization. By killing the Romanovs now, the assassins have robbed me of my chance to make justification for their deaths."" He rubbed his hands at the genius of it all. ""At this terrible onslaught by human assassins, rebel and loyalist alike will beg me for protection and the vampire world will be united once more. I shall repair the wounds created by Isaac Van Helsing all those years ago."" Seras saw a flaw with this plan. ""But my king, what about these mystery assassins? Won""t they strike again?"" Alucard laughed and wrung his hands.",1220273

""Won""t that be dangerous?"" asked Travis. ""Yes. Just remember your training."" ""And do not worry. We will catch them off-guard and they won""t stand a chance against us."" Otulissa spoke out. ""And...what about Kludd?"" ""What about him?"" ""You know if he sees me with you, he""ll literally devour me in shreds."" ""Well, he""ll have to get through us first."" Digger said. ""Oh, sure.

""He doesn""t know what I got."" ""We""ve battled St. Aggie""s before and there""s no doubt we can do it again. All we have to do is come up with something."" Gylfie said.

All of a sudden, one tyto seeks Travis standing with the Guardians and decides to wait until he""s alone so he can defeat him. Boron flies towards them and calls out for Ezylryb and Otulissa. Both of them looked at Travis and wished him good luck and flies off with him. Boron tells the others, ""Keep an eye out. They can be anywhere.""

3200,"She always said hello when we met, and sometimes we""d talk for a little while."" ""Did you find her attractive?"" Dylan laughed. ""Detective, I was twenty years old,"" he said. ""The only girls I saw regularly were Jordan and my sister. I""d probably have found any girl attractive, just because I really needed a change. But Natalya really was attractive. She had those wonderful eyes, like a doe, and her hair was soft. And the greatest thing was that she wasn""t arrogant or anything. At least not more than Jordan or Sunny. Well, Sunny was still a child,"" he amended. ""But unfortunately, Natalya never fancied me. She preferred someone else, if you take my meaning."" ""Jamie Jarvis."" It wasn""t a question. Dylan nodded. ""Sunday still insists that this was only a rumor, and that there was nothing between Jamie and Natalya, but frankly, I don""t know why she denies it so vehemently. I mean, it was pretty obvious. Jamie was twenty-four years old, very good-looking, and very mature for his age. It was only natural that she felt attracted by him. And moreover, Gabe and Graham and I, we were all younger than her."" ""You think that would have been a problem?"" ""Most women like older men,"" said Dylan with a shrug. ""Don""t you, Detective Rush?"" Lilly was a little taken aback, but she did not hold it against Dylan. ""Depends,"" she said evasively. ""Your sister described Natalya as scheming and men-crazy,"" Chris remarked. ""That doesn""t seem to fit your description of her."" ""Did Sunny really say that?"" Dylan shook his head in surprise. ""I didn""t have the impression that she was always chasing after the men. She hardly ever went out, and I can""t remember that she ever tried to make a pass at me or Graham."" ""Your sister said she did."" ""Sunny must""ve mixed things up,"" Dylan said determinedly. ""Or maybe she really thought so. I mean, she was only thirteen years old. Maybe she thought a smile was an unmistakable signal."" ""She didn""t seem to be mixing things up. She said Natalya was trying all of you, but you never reacted."" Dylan sneered. ""It was more the other way around,"" he said. ""She turned her back on us. But in a friendly way,"" he added hastily. ""She just made us understand that she already had her eyes set on someone else."" ""What about the other thing your sister said? That Natalya was scheming?"" ""Scheming... well, I thought until yesterday that she made for the hills with the car and the money, so I thought of course she was scheming - in retrospect, I mean. But apart from that, I never had the impression of her being such a bitch. And if it""s really her out there, then I suppose she was a poor thing rather than a scheming monster."" ""What can you tell us about Jamie? Why did he leave?"" ""No one knows."" Lilly had expected this answer. ""He just left."" ""Any guesses?"" ""Chasing after his lover? Chasing butterflies?"" Dylan shrugged. ""I really don""t know, Detective."" Lilly sighed and focused on another question. ""Can you tell us anything in general about Jamie?"" she asked. ""What kind of guy was he?"" ""He was the coolest,"" said Dylan with warmth.",240213

The mystery figure stopped cold. ""Ricky?"" That voice... Ulrich stared at the figure. It was lithe and small, more girlish. The figure ripped off the full mask and a mass of light brown hair flowed out. Sure enough, it was Lyra, dressed in a custom cat suit and kicking their tails like a pro. ""What are you guys doing here?"" she demanded. ""We could ask you the same thing!"" Odd grumbled from the opposite wall. ""I was hunting- Are you guys in league with Code?"" ""Code?""

That""s a helpful hacker..."" ""I also traced him to this exact place. He thinks this is a game. Some way to slake his boredom. I""m going to end his ""game"" for good."" She pressed enter, and watched with satisfaction as the lines of code were swiftly stripped from the screen, blocking all the points. ""I don""t know how he pulled off the school vandalization though; that""s another story."" Lyra continued. Sparks flew from the gyro-globe. It flashed from Lyoko to blue, until the sparks gathered and centered on one point: Lyra. ""Lyra!"" cried Ulrich, but he was too late. She was zapped and in a flash of light she was gone. ""Lyra?"" Ulrich choked out. ""Whoa. Power trip..."" she said from the opposite wall. ""Lyra!"" Ulrich was by her side in an instant. ""Hey..."" The floor panel beneath her gave way and she fell into a room full of metal cylinders running from the roof to the floor. ""Stay right there, I""ll come and get you."" Ulrich told her. She rolled her eyes, but obeyed. Her ankle was throbbing. She leaned back against the metal wall and sighed. ""Just my luck..."" One of the metal cylinders hissed open, letting a light fog roll out. A dark figure stood inside. ""Yep, just my luck... ULRICH!"" AK: Lyra is a walking magnet for trouble... After all, she""s Ulrich""s kid sister. R&R, please. XS 4 ""So this is the real world..."" the dark figure""s voice was awestruck and sultry. ""Who are you?"" Lyra demanded, still putting up her brave front.

1128,"""M-merci, Adrien..."" Mari fidgeted in her seat as her best friend watched with a smirk. She dreamily watched him chat with Nino about the events of the modeling gig from yesterday. ""You totally wore that to look good for Adrien, didn""t you?"" Alya whispered conspiratorially. ""No!"" Mari whispered back. ""Just a little... But I did want to test it out. I really like the way the design of this skirt came out."" ""Hmm..."" her best friend wasn""t buying it. The rest of the day was full of compliments on her outfit, some from upperclassmen and others from the assistant art instructor Theo Barbeau. She was bubbling with happiness and euphoria, by the time math rolled around. Eli came late to school, but he had an excuse. He went to his seat in the back, near Nathanael. A few moments into class, Mari""s phone vibrated. She looked down to see it was a text from Eli. E: Like the outfit. The skirt would look better w/cardigan tho ;) Mari rolled her eyes and sent a quick reply. M: That""s a date look. This is a trip to the Brat""s Lair. Vest works for this. Mme. Mendeleiev chose that moment to reprimand Chloe for texting and Mari stealthily slipped her phone back into her bag. As Chloe argued that she was simply texting her driver to be ready after school. ""This is totally ridicule! Ridicule!"" Chloe pouted as Mendeleiev continued with her lesson, confiscating her phone. Adrien glanced over, not for the first time, at Mari as she gazed at Chloe""s room. It was pretty huge, fitting Mari""s room in it three times over. But I still prefer Mari""s room to this mausoleum, Adrien thought to himself, remembering the warmth of the Dupain-Cheng household. ""Mademoiselle Bourgeois, your snacks are here."" a maid said from the doorway. Chloe dismissed the older woman with a flick of her hand. ""Sabrina, bring the snacks over here. You are going to love this Eli-poo-"" Eli and the rest of the gang winced at the nickname. ""-I""ve got the best pastries in Paris. My chef is world-class."" Eli plucked a cream puff from the tray Sabrina wheeled in front of the quintet of friend and tossed it into his mouth without preamble. Adrien simply went with a fluffy looking croissant that was heavier than it looked. He tore off a piece and popped it in his mouth, only to find himself frowning. It tasted- ""Too sweet!"" Eli exclaimed, grabbing a napkin to spit it out into. ""Gross!"" ""It can""t be!"" Chloe gasped. ""Really?"" Alya and Mari picked a danish to share, after chewing it for a moment, forcibly swallowed the bites. ""It tastes like someone mixed too much sugar into this filling."" Alya grimaced. Given their danish was a cream cheese and strawberry one, the result would be disgusting. Mari had her fingers pressed to her lips and was staring at the pastry, hard. As a baker""s daughter, she was probably affronted. ""Well don""t trust you!"" Chloe picked up a cream puff and took a bite. ""Ew! This is disgusting!"" Chloe marched over to the phone and called down to the kitchen. Trepidation filled Adrien. He had a bad feeling Chat Noir was going to be necessary after this.",3439302

The KND declared war against the ones responsible for the death of Sector V... so if you or anyone else have seen Mr. Boss, Mr. Wink, Mr. Fibb, Mr. Fizz, and Knightbrace, do not call the police, do not contact other KND operatives, just make them suffer worse than Sector V has suffered, even if you happen to have a board and a nail in your possession!",910821
1595,"""Whoa what in the world is that?"" Clu shook his head in confusion to Annie""s question. Carey used a chair for support against his shaking knees. ""I know what that was"" Everyone turned to Fi. ""What was it Fi? We are waiting for an explanation"" Fi turned to Annie and smiled at her. ""Okay... now before anyone says anything... I got a story for you."" Jack opened his mouth to protest but Carey motioned for him to listen. Annie, Carey, Clu and Jack sat down on the ground meanwhile Fi sat down in the chair in front of her... she scanned the papers and put them down. ""Okay the story I have to tell you takes place in the past. The year was 1930... it revolves around a young boy named Daniel McMann. Daniel lived in this actual house. Daniel wasn""t popular but he wasn""t unpopular... he was unknown to the town of Hope Springs. Daniel didn""t really have friends but he didn""t really have enemies either... he was a sweet boy and was nice to anyone and everyone. Well one day in school... Hope springs high.... Daniel was sitting down at the cafeteria table eating his usual ham and cheese sandwich enjoying his lunch not bothering anyone when two popular kids David Phillips and Clark Bell walked over to Daniel and poured milk all over him for no reason at all. All the kids in the school broke out in laughter.... Except one girl.... Stephanie Thielen... she was dating David Phillips.... She wasn""t laughing because she did not find what they were doing to Daniel funny. Daniel grabbed his books and ran.... He ran as fast as he could... not looking back. He staggered back to his home trying to breathe but he felt as if he was being choked... Daniel ran into his house and collapsed onto the living room floor... where you are sitting now. See there was something that Clark, David and even Stephanie didn""t know... Daniel was allergic to milk and if he came in contact with milk the results could be deadly. So lying on the floor Daniel felt his body go weak... bumps appeared on his face and his breathing stopped.... Because of David and Clark""s little prank Daniel lost his life... in this same house and David and Clark were never caught because Stephanie Thielen, the only one who could bring justice to the town of Hope Springs for Daniel covered for them"" Annie, Carey, Clu and Jack stared at Fi in silence. ""And I think because he was wronged and died before his time his spirit has lived on to torment the people who did this to him... trying to right a wrong. Carey asked me how we were a part of this.... David, Clark, and Stephanie were our great great grandparents"" Again Carey, Clu, Jack and Annie stared at Fi in silence. Annie got up messing with her hair. ""So you""re saying our ancestors wronged Daniel McMann and now we are paying for it? Because they did a bad we are gonna die?"" Fi shook her head. ""Not necessarily. If we can find a way to help Daniel get justice for what happened to him he might let us go"" ""This is nonsense Fiona! The spirit of Daniel McMann is not trying to make us pay for something our ancestors did to him in 1930.",29783
3547,"The Doctor: I didn""t lie to her. I""m pretty sure that something of what Rose and the other Doctor share will reach me, too. We""re the same person, him and me. And whenever I get lonely and wish that Rose were here, I can draw on the knowledge that she already is with me, exactly where she belongs. I""ll miss Donna. She was brilliant, and it caused me almost physical pain to take all that away from her. But her life was more important. Now she""ll never know what a hero she was. She might have weird dreams, the way I did when I became human, but she""ll never know they were anything but dreams. I""ll miss Martha, too. But she""s back with UNIT, and it""s not impossible that our paths will cross again. She remembers, and she is on this earth. Sarah Jane is back with her son. I thought she never married - there""s some story she""s got to tell me, and maybe I should just show up on her doorstep one day for a chat between old friends. I promise I won""t try to persuade her to come back with me to the TARDIS. Jack Harkness has run back to his team, to Gwen Cooper, whose ancestor I once met when I was a different man, and Ianto Jones. They seem good people, and a good team. I can see why Jack wanted to return to them. But, old friend, our paths will certainly cross again. And yes, Rose, I""ll miss you, too, but not with the despair and loneliness I""ve been missing you in those last two years. I""ll think of you fondly, knowing that you""re with another part of me that knows how to give you the love you deserve. So in a way you were right - we are staying together forever. So now, my good old TARDIS, it""s time to start over. Let""s see where we end up, and whom we meet along the way. Right now I""m lonely, so lonely, and we""ve got to do something about it. Goodbye, my faithful companions. You were all brilliant. xxxTHE ENDxxx End Note: This will not be continued, as the story of Rose and the Doctor is, I feel, sufficiently told. Feel free, however, to re-read this as often as you like. If I""m ever going to take up 10/Rose again, it will certainly be another story, not this one. One thing more: I noticed that quite a couple of people have favorited this story and/or put it on story alert, and I thank you very much for that. Still I""d be even happier if you also left a review ;) I""d like to know which one you liked most/least, how you liked the concept, if it""s too fluffy, etc.... Thank you, and see you around. If not for Who, then maybe for Torchwood ;) Companions Companions A short, sweet moment. Set after some unseen adventure... somewhere in the middle of the season, I""d say. Rose I feel a little light-headed, but fine. It""s the high after a won battle. I""m really getting used to that. The Doctor has a spring in his step, too, and all of a sudden he slips an arms around my shoulders and pulls me close to him. ""Rose Tyler, did I ever tell you I""m really, really glad I found you?"" I smile up at him and snuggle a little closer to him, slipping my own arm around his slender waist. ""Nope,"" I say. ""Although I hoped you would.""",240213
1447,"He kept his eyes closed but he raised his hand to his head as he situated himself into a much more comfortable spot. ""Scared of storms,"" he asked as he face still faced the ceiling. ""Kinda,"" I answered from under my sheets. ""Their not that bad,"" he answered. ""Yeah, well, maybe not to you, but to me it is,"" I squealed as another loud crack sounded throughout the room. ""Come on, get over here you little mouse,"" Matt chuckled finally looking over at me with his eyes open. He scooted over and raised the sheets as I got up and practically sprinted to his bed. Jumping in, I snuggled into him relishing in his warmth. He wrapped his arms around me so we fit better lying on his bed. He didn""t say a word to me as he pulled me close. I knew what he was thinking. He was thinking about that call I had gotten this morning from the doctor saying he was having to push the date of my surgery back a week because he had someone who was in dire need of one right now. I agreed as soon as he convinced me, that I would be fine until the appointment. Matt, however, was not convinced. ""You feeling alright,"" Matt asked for about the 100th time that day, or night, or day...or...whatever. ""I""m fine, Matt,"" I whispered. ""I know, I was just checking,"" He replied as he kissed my forehead. I rolled my eyes before closing them as darkness took over me. In his arms I slept a whole lot better than in my own bed. This house was just way to creepy to be sleeping alone. However, my eyes darted open the moment I heard Matt groan. ""You alright,"" I asked looking over at him. ""No, not really,"" Matt answered with his eyes closed. ""What""s wrong,"" I questioned leaning up out of his arms. ""Don""t move,"" Matt warned. ""Why,"" I asked noticing his strained expression. ""Because your knee is brushing up against a certain part of my body it shouldn""t,"" Matt chuckled as I realized why he had groaned. Looking down I realized my knee was near his groin. I laughed lightly as I removed it. ""Sorry, you""re just warm,"" I chuckled as I laid back down. Matt""s eyes opened and looked at me closely. It was like he was taking a picture with his eyes. Like he was trying to file this moment away. It""s then when I understood why he was doing it. ""Matt..."" I began as I went to lecture him, but his lips met mine, silencing my retort. Giving in, I leaned in. His lips were so warm, and inviting. His arms wrapped around me and tightened as he brought me closer. I didn""t stop him, when he pushed himself up, without breaking the kiss, laid himself on top of me. Nor did I stop him, when I felt his hand slip under my tank top. I just let him do what he wanted. What was the point of stopping him, because deep down, both of us knew we wanted this moment? We both knew that we needed this moment. I felt his lips leave mine as they trailed their way across my jaw and down my neck to my collarbone. I felt his other hand join the first as they lifted up my tank-top. Matt pulled away as he lifted it over my head and then threw it to the floor beside his bed. Matt looked down at me lovingly.",806976
1717,"I froze and Italy gasped, ""Cosa? Perché non ci rac-?"" ""Ruhig sein!"" Switzerland hissed. His tone shut the Italian up, and to my alarm I discovered why; the footsteps had stopped. My breath caught in my throat, and for a few terrified moments I waited for the sound of rushed feet and for the door to fly open. That never happened, and after a minute of tense silence, the footsteps started again. All three of us sighed in relief, and Switzerland glared into the darkness of the sewer, while Italy muttered an apology. He again offered me his hands, and I grudgingly took them. He helped me into the hole and Italy caught me before Switzerland let me go. The only light was from Switzerland""s flashlight, and unlike most sewers, there was no damp or water at all. Everything was dry, dark, and crusted with filth. Italy handed my bags as Switzerland jumped into the hole behind us, then pulled the cover back over it. He took point again, leading us through the dank sewer tunnel. I stuck close to Italy and Switzerland, holding the hand of the latter as the both of us jumped at every sound. Even our footsteps echoed here when they hit a patch of cracked sewer cement that wasn""t as caked with grime as the rest. The air was much, much colder, and I wrapped my jacket around me even tighter with the hand not clinging to Italy. Switzerland walked just a foot or two ahead of us with a flashlight in one hand and a rifle in the other. ""H-how far is it?"" I said after jumping again and the sound of footsteps above us. There were many of them now, like we were right under an open street. I realized we probably were, and my blood ran cold. What were Switzerland and Germany doing in the place crawling with so many French Empire soldiers? How had they not been found yet? ""Not much farther,"" Switzerland grumbled, turning yet another corner in this maze of sewers beneath the even worse maze of Berlin. After probably a half hour of traversing the sewers, Switzerland stopped at a heavy, rusted door. He took out a small key and unlocked it before turning to us, ""Stay here."" I would have protested had he given me the chance, but before I could get a sound out, Switzerland was already inside. He was only gone for a second or two before opening the door the rest of the way and letting us in, closing the locking the door behind us. The room was as dark as the sewers until Switzerland pulled some matches off a counter and lit thick candles placed around the room. There were crates stacked haphazardly around with random things scattered. The room was small claustrophobically small, but there was another door in the back that I moved to before Switzerland stopped me. ""I need to talk to Germany before you see him."" ""Germany""s in there?"" Italy said, hesitating for a moment before launching himself at the door, ""Germania! Ludwig, Ludwig, it""s-"" ""How many times do I have to tell you to shut up?"" Switzerland hissed again before slamming his rifle down and dropping his bags.",748687
739,"""How dare you touch me!"" she exclaimed, surprising the young hero as he retreated his hand. ""Sorry."" he muttered as he walked towards the counter to pay for his items. Tatsumaki stared up at his walking figure with a glare. She hates to admit that she like getting pat on her head. But there was no way in hell would she openly show it. Especially since it was the A-class nobody that did it to her. After paying for his goods, Saitama walked towards the small esper. ""I just need to drop these off at my place."" he said, to which Tatsumaki only answered with a ""hmph"". Luckily for him, he somehow got used to her attitude. ""It""s kinda weird seeing you out here. Especially when you""re not in your usual dress."" he said without looking down on her. ""I""m still on a break. No use to wear my outfit."" she replied just as flatly. Saitama only nodded. Silence dawned upon them for a few moments before Saitama broke the silence. ""Sorry for patting your head back at the grocery. I guess I invaded your personal space, huh? I totally get you."" he said as he glanced at her. Slightly surprised, Tatsumaki looked up at him. Somehow, she felt kind of bad for yelling at him. Wait what? Tatsumaki shook her head brashly. What in the hell is she feeling?! ""Cut the crap and quit being nice."" she snapped back with her arms crossed. Saitama only nodded. He may understand her attitude because of her past, but she""s being difficult, he thought. ""Well, it""s about time to have lunch. Want to stop by at my place first? King""s coming over and... uh... some dude I met days ago. I think."" Saitama offered. Tatsumaki was still being wary over the hero""s actions, but since she hadn""t thought up of what to eat yet, she decided to accept his offer. ""Fine. Let""s be quick with it."" she replied brashly. Reaching Saitama""s apartment, the two entered his humble home. ""My place is pretty small compared to yours but make yourself at home."" he said as he placed his groceries on his kitchen counter. Tatsumaki removed her coat and boots as she walked inside. It was indeed small, and she can""t imagine how King would fit in here. As Saitama began to prepare lunch, she sat down in front of the small table and placed her coat beside her. ""How do you manage to fit guests in here?"" Tatsumaki asked plainly. ""Geez, it may be small but it""s the best I""ve got. It""s free. And if I remember correctly, you ruined my previous apartment."" Saitama said, not taking his focus off of what he was doing. With a huff, Tatsumaki crossed her arms. She felt that damned feeling of guilt but this time, she suppressed it. ""It""s not my fault that those damned monsters"" HQ was right under your apartment."" ""Yeah. But you gotta control your power sometimes. I mean, consider your environment. Citizens might be put in danger and buildings with innocent people in it might get hurt."" ""I can control my powers just fine, baldy! Who the hell are you to tell me how to use my powers anyway?!"" Saitama decided not to argue further and focused on his cooking. Silence was again broke when a knock rang around his apartment. ""Must be King.""",2750536
1692,"""What?"" ""I told you to zip it."" ""Oh come on, you need rest."" Clara rolled her eyes and nodded. ""Fine. I""ll sleep. But only if you promise to come back."" She looked at him deeply. ""Sure. I promise."" He promised and kissed her forehead. Then, he left. Clara frowned and closed her eyes. Not a moment had passed, she fell into a deep sleep. OUTSIDE~ ""There you are, Alfred!"" Australia greeted his brother. ""Hey."" The American gloomily replied. Australia gave him a noogie in the head. ""Aw come on! It""s not the first time you kissed your mate, mate!"" Alfred laughed and punched his arm playfully. ""Yeah. Those were the days. The happy days."" Alfred said, remembering those memories. ""Anyway, your boss called. And MacArthur is in my tent right now."" Australia guided Alfred to his tent and there, MacArthur was there. ""Mr. Jones. I was ordered by the president to come here and liberate you."" McArthur said. Alfred""s jaw opened in shock. ""L-liberate Philippines? But why? I-I thought I am here to protect Philippines from Japan and his allies!"" Alfred protested to MacArthur. ""Orders are orders, Mr. Jones."" He sadly said. Alfred frowned. ""What does he want me to do."" He seriously said. ""He wants you to liberate me to Australia and you go to Europe. Italian and German forces are causing fiasco to every nation there."" MacArthur told the flustered nation. ""Feliciano causing destruction? Maybe Lovino was right that Ludwig is brainwashing him.' Alfred thought. ""And, you""ll leave two days from now. That is all. Good day to both you."" The general said and left the two other nations. ""Damn. What""ll I do? What""ll happen to Clara? Aussie, help me!"" Alfred panicked. ""Why don""t you assign someone to protect her?"" The Australian suggested. ""Great idea! You""ll do it!"" Australia looked at him with a shocked expression. ""I was just suggesting! And besides, I still have to-"" ""What do you want?"" ""What do you mean by that?"" ""I""ll give you anything you want! Even my independence if I have to!"" Australia was shocked at his last statement. ""H-his independence? H-he""s giving up his independece for her?' He thought deeply. Then, he looked at the serious nation in his front. ""Fine. If only you give me anything I ask you."" The American""s eyes gleamed with stars. ""Thank you so much, dude! I owe you big time!"" The two brofisted. ""And my next problem is, how will I tell it to Clara."" Alfred said. ""Spill it carefully and gently, mate. As easy as that."" Alfred glared at him. ""It""s not as easy as it seems."" Australia flinched and laughed softly. ""I know, dude. Soften and calm her down first."" Alfred thought about it for a while. ""Maybe I""ll buy that. Come on, I""ll tell her now."" They went out of Aussie""s tent and headed to Alfred""s tent. Opening the flap, Clara was there sleeping peacefully. Alfred sighed in relief and went inside while Australia just stayed outside. Alfred sat beside her. ""You look so beautiful while sleeping. That priceless face..."" While caressing her cheeks, she woke up and was happy enough to see him. With the excitement, she sat up and hugged him tightly.",2750536
356,"At least it was better stocked than his kitchen. He followed me there, wordless, then to the couch. Zen sat beside me, weary to keep as much distance as possible. I felt my heart shattering. Had I scared him off finally? If not, he would after I told him... Seeing the darkness settle over my face, Zen scooted a bit closer and held out his arm with a tight-lipped grin, ""Alright, then."" I didn""t smile, but I did take his hand. I hesitated over the blood, smeared over his left forearm in the shape of a ""C"". The stone in my stomach sank deeper and twisted. I""d done that. Not the miraculous breaking down the door he""d done. This was me. ""I can clean it off,"" Zen leaned over for the alcohol wipes and tissues, slowly pulling away from me again. I stopped him, plucking them out of his hands and tearing open one of the wipe packages. I did this. I was going to fix it, ""J-just stay st-still."" And he did, as I touched his arm with shaking fingers and wiped off the blood with the cloth. And revealed to me was nothing more than fresh, smooth skin. A thin red mark was all that remained of whatever horrid gash I""d torn in his skin. My gaze snapped his in shock. It had only been less than half a day. And he smiled, this time a real one full of tenderness, ""I""m an alien according to Seven, remember?"" ""Oh... right,"" My eyes fell back to his arm. At this rate, the mark would be gone completely in another hour. An uncomfortable silence stretched between us. After a solid ten minutes, Zen gathered up the medical supplies and put them away without a word. Then he sat back down. The only sound was the incessant ping of his cell phone on the counter. When I looked at it, he sighed, ""The guys are losing their minds in the chat right now."" ""Shouldn""t you-?"" He caught my gaze and held it, ruby eyes devoid of their usual cheer, ""No. You""re more important right now."" I couldn""t look away for the longest time. But the weight of what I""d divulged to Jaehee, what Luciel already knew and I was about to tell Zen, won out. I turned away from him, facing the black television, and focused on my hands. Zen must have felt the mood of the room changing, and said simply, ""Jaehee said you wanted to talk to me."" It took me another full minute to answer with a nod, ""Yeah."" ""Is it about your panic attack at the apartment?"" ""Yeah."" Then he said something that shocked me, even though I should have expected it, ""You don""t have to tell me anything. I will never force you to."" I couldn""t help it; I looked back at him, slack-jawed. But he was only smiling that concerned, sweet little smile of his. Zen was giving me an out. No one gave me outs. Except... Zen had before, hadn""t he? In the chat, on the phone, on our impromptu ""date""... he""d always given me the chance to back out. ""I know..."" I looked down at my entwined fingers against my thighs. I smiled, almost, ""But I need to. No..."" I nodded, sure of something for the first time in years, ""I want to."" And all he said was ""Okay."" The words were hard to find.",748687
3660,"When I""m hero-ing. It seems so easy to be brave and graceful...The mask is really cathartic"" Chat frowned. ""So just channel the mask."" She frowned. ""That won""t work."" ""Just in short bursts; have you ever tried it?"" She looked pensive before sheepishly shaking her head. ""Iris my case, then."" He presented her with a blue violet bloom of said plant. ""Chat seriously, where do you get these pun? They are awful!"" his lady laughed. ""Don""t you mean..."" ""Chat, no! I swear-"" ""Paw-ful?"" She groaned as he laughed. He knew she liked his puns, deep inside. ""Lets"" finish our patrol, so I can get away from your cheesy puns."" She whipped out her yoyo, a new light in her movements. ""And my advice?"" She looked at him over her shoulder. ""I""ll take it with a grain of salt, mon minou. Now let""s go. The south side of Paris is calling."" And so Chat followed his newly revived lady into the night. AK: I really wish more happened in this chapter but this is literally just a prequel for what is to come. Don""t despair my fellow Miraculous Sinners, there will be more to come, especially LadyNoir, and MariChat. R&R, s""il vous plait! Chapter 5: ""Wow, Marinette you look cute today."" Rose commented as the bluenette walked into class, flanked by Alya. ""Yeah, super cute."" Kim grinned. He gave a wolf whistle too, only to be hit on the head by Alix. Mari blushed. ""Merci, Rose, Kim."" Did she really look that different today? She wondered this as she took her seat. After getting back from patrol as Ladybug and with Chat""s oddly great advice in her head, she""d planned an outfit for the big visit to Chloe""s, with input from Tikki. At the moment, she wore a high-waisted thigh length soft gray skirt with a sedate pink quarter-sleeve shirt embroidered with a cursive ""L""Amour"". Her usual dark gray jacket was swapped for a white denim vest. Her red hair ribbons were swapped for matching pink hair ribbons. She wore her usual ballet flats adorned her feet and her usual side bag, complete with Tikki and a small cache of cookies rested at her side. ""Big plans after school today?"" Juleka asked. Mari looked to Alya who frowned at her.""Well..."" ""Well, I see you tried to look presentable,"" sneered Chloe from her seat. Her eyes assessed Mari""s outfit in one sweep. ""It""s no better than what you usually wear."" Mari ignored that jab, instead taking her seat. Alya followed her. ""See?"" Alya hissed low under her breath. ""This is why we should leave Eli and the boys to their doom with stupid Chloe."" It had taken copious amounts of pleading, begging and bribery to get Alya to agree to come with them to Chloe""s. If there was a set limit on best friend favors, Mari was sure she""d have maxed out for a month. ""I can handle Chloe. I know I can. I""ve done it before. I just need to remember that this is about making sure Chloe doesn""t mess with our guys, and Eli."" Alya smirked. ""So now Adrien is your guy?"" Mari blushed even deeper. ""It""s a work in progress..."" ""Bonjour, Marinette. What""s a work in progress?"" asked Adrien, just entering the class and taking his seat. ""Adrien!",3439302

Mayor I.R. like mazes."" As he tries to solve the maze the screen suddenly turns black, and then a picture of The Queen of the Black Puddle in her monster form appears on the screen and makes a extremely loud scream. Mayor I.R. Baboon then makes a frightened scream, then Princess joins in on screaming in pure fright, Then Mayor I.R. Baboon screams at the sight of her then he looks at his pants and says, ""Uh oh, Mayor I.R. Baboon make pee-pee in pants!"" Courage Jr. then asks Princess, ""Let me guess, you saw that image didn""t you?"" Princess nods. Then he continues, ""Sorry but we used the image of your mom because me and dad considered the most frightening creature we ever faced in our lives.

3398,"""Run Margaret!"" She shouted, her hands held up again making another force field. Chitai leaking up from behind the pile, Margaret went running as fast she could. Their fire merely hitting against the shield, she was weak, only able to maintain simple things, a force field was not one of them. Her vision blurred and blood ran from her nose, she groaned, the shield disappeared and she fell back into a heap on the ground. She blankly stared up at the blue sky, taking in heavy breaths and feeling herself slowly fall into the abyss of darkness. The last thing she saw before her eyelids closed was a towering figure, all she knew was he was not chitari. Her eyelids snapped shut and her head lazily slumped over to the side and then... She was lost. It was cold, not that usual cold, but cold. It felt nice over her bare skin and the sheets that cluttered to her body were soft and plush. The pillow beneath her head providing the greatest of support and dim light fell over her clean pale skin. Her eyes flashed open and although what she was seeing was not at all home to her, she remained calm. She pulled her body up to sit, realizing that she was naked, her clothes gone and her skin now unburdened with no dirt and cuts. Her head pounded lightly, her hair flowing down her shoulders and misty blue eyes surrounded with sand. She wiped her eyes to clarify that what she was seeing was in fact real. She had never been in such an extravagant place. The tapestries that hung off the wall were beautiful woven with green emeralds and gems embedded into the fabric. The floor was a black tile and the door across from the bed was oaken and huge as was the bed. It possessed the finest green silks she had ever seen which wrapped her nude body pleasantly. She was so overwhelmed with her surroundings that she almost felt it was a dream, or that she was in heaven. She went to stand up from the bed, but felt a metal encircling her left ankle. She stood on her one leg and tossed the covers over coming in sight with the chain that held her down. This was no dream, it was a nightmare, she was trapped. ""Hello!"" She shouted into the empty room towards the door. ""Help! I can""t get out! Somebody!"" She felt all hope was last as when she attempted to use her magic to release herself she couldn""t. It scared her, that she couldn""t use her magic like she wished. She tried several times before giving up completely and laying on the bed with utter boredom. ""God help me."" ""I can do that."" She went frigid with shock, angling her head she came face to face with a refined man, he appeared the same age as her. His black hair slicked back and two king blue eyes threw her into a trance. She rushed to pull the covers over her body and bit her bottom lip vigorously. ""W-Who the fuck are you?"" He remembered a certain someone asking the same question, but in a different manner years ago... Years ago. She reminded him so much of her, her facial features, her attitude. He knew she was searching around New York""s destroyed self and was brought back to remember his one true love.",6234395
3012,"(just don""t get him chibified or something...) Rei is still cute as ever. (Happy smile) Chapter 13 Afternoon ""Mom, we""re home!"" Rei hollered in the doorway, opening the door for both of them. Both slid in quietly, soundly kicking their shoes off the doorway. Rei threw his bag on the couch, sitting beside it as well. He thought over the situation, his mind lost. Yuuya sensed his apprehension in starting a conversation. Quietly, he excused himself as he walked upwards to his room, leaving Rei alone in the living room. The phone rang. Rei gazed at it cautiously, deciding to let the answering machine take the call. A few more rings and Yuuya""s cheery recorded voice was played (""Hi! This is residence of the Otohata""s! Sorry, nobody""s here to answer you. Just leave your message after the tone!"") ""Rei..."" The voice spoke eerily, in a singsong tone. The boy""s eyes shook up, a bit terrified by it. He stood up, his hands reaching out towards the machine, shaking a bit as if trusting it to bite back. ""I know you""re in there...pick the receiver up...I know you want to hear me ouuuuut..."" The voice taunted all the more. Rei cocked his eyebrows, enraged at the audacity of the caller. He took the receiver up and listened, perceiving that the caller on the other side laughed. ""Quit fooling around with me, Akai. What do you want this time? Did you advertise your ""obsession"" about me in the news this time?"" Rei spoke, venom evident in his voice. The other stopped being jovial. ""Nice one, Otohata. Nice..."" Akai grunted, his tone of someone stumped. ""This evening, I want you and Asou to walk across downtown, near the fountain. I""ve my company to wait for you there."" ""And what do you plan to do?"" Rei asked haughtily, trying not to show regret in his voice. Because he really regretted going through all of this, foremost asking this guy""s ""service"". ""Uh, not much. Just having the hell out of you beaten up. I told them that they should first know that they want Yuuya. You go defend him, outnumber you, and let Yuuya see you being beaten so he""d really cry it up. If that happens, you""d have your first chance of telling him your otherwise feelings for him..."" Akai drawled, obviously bored of narrating his plan. ""No."" Silence. ""Excuse me? Did I just hear you say...no?"" The caller sounded bewildered. ""Yes, you did. I don""t think that""s safe...both for me and Yuuya. Just call it off..."" Rei stopped short when he heard something breaking in the background. ""I don""t think you understand one thing, Mr. Rei Otohata. ""I""am in charge here. ""I"" say so what and whatnot to call off. ""I"" will decide things whether they""re safe or not. Honestly, I don""t give a damn what happens what. I will do this job professionally because I make sure that I perform my job well. And performing the job entrusted to ""me"", means I don""t give a damn about safety. I""m no matchmaking agency; I am the last resort people come to when they""re in trouble. And that means even if putting them into more trouble just to come out of the ones they""re escaping is what I have to do...then so be it."" He said, calmly.",583064
1359,"""Alright..."" Kim sang back. She came into the room wearing a lime green turtleneck dress, with black thigh length tights and black wedge-heeled lace-up boots. Her short red-dyed hair was tied to the side and cascaded over her left shoulder. ""You look amazing, Kim!"" Pucca gushed. ""Not as amazing as you do. Is that a new dress? She was decked out in a Victorian style dress with a red base. Her dress was moderately puffy and probably harder to walk in, but she insisted on looking like a princess when her ""prince"" bestowed his undying love upon her. ""Uncle Dumpling had it made especially for today..."" She twirled in it. ""Isn""t it fabulous?"" Pucca beamed. ""Well the party people are arriving. All we""re missing is the star of the show. You""d better hurry up."" Garu trudged through the forest, carrying his present for Pucca on his back. He hoped she wouldn""t hold this morning attitude against him. He""d had to protect his secret project from her at all costs. He chuckled to himself. Only two years ago and he wouldn""t have dared to hope Pucca would forgive him. But a lot had changed since then. She""d changed a lot since then. While Pucca had always been adorable (adorably annoying as well) as an eleven year old, the teenage Pucca had grown into the adorability and conformed it to beauty. Her night-black hair now reached the backs of her knees, kept up either by elastic bands or her freakishly powerful telekinesis, her deep brown eyes that were usually aimed at him in love, now framed by long lashes that just set off her porcelain skin, her cheerful giggle when he said something sarcastic; what wasn""t to love. He really hoped she liked the silver statue he""d molded in her likeness. He had been studying the silversmith craft for a little over a year now, since he""d heard she loved silver. Now he could give her a statue to match her beauty and purity. He cursed as he sensed his old enemy, Tobey. ""We meet again, Garu,"" Tobey growled. The eighteen year old ninja was dressed as if they were still thirteen. ""What Toby? I""m kind of busy."" ""Busy dodging my assassination attempts!"" Tobey roared. He leaped at Garu, eyes red with rage and insomnia. Garu dodged and started ninja-sprinting through the trees, Tobey not too far behind. Splitting into three ""Garu""s, the real Garu dropped the statue off by the sewage pipes, careful not to let it fall into the leak the city still hadn""t fixed. Then he jumped back into the fight. Darting this way and that in the branches, the two ninjas parried and lunged at leisure until they fell into the Goh-Rong. The party music whirred to an abrupt stop and the guests stared in shock. ""Garu, man,"" his best friend Abyo called to get his attention. It wasn""t until some unknown force yanked him out of Tobey""s reach that he noticed an angry looking Pucca. ""My DRESS!"" she shrieked at them. AnimeKitty: Oh, no! They ruined the dress! I spent a lot of time deciding what it would look like! LOL! Anyways, I""m going to be taking break from a few of my fanfictions, like Funny Love High (FLH) and Midnight Sparkle.",3439302
2855,"the bald hero said as he picked his nose. ""They should be taught a lesson for dirtying your name!"" the cyborg reasoned. Saitama could only sigh. ""Look, there are still plenty of newspaper companies all over the world. Destroying one wouldn""t make a difference. Sure, not all of them are completely bogus, but most of them are."" he said, hoping that Genos would understand so that they could stop talking about the stupid article. It was making his head ache. Fortunately for Saitama, Genos nodded in agreement. ""I guess you are right, sensei."" he responded before writing some new notes on his notebook. Genos remembered the time when Saitama defeated the Sea King. The bald hero never did care about his reputation, as long as he was able to contribute for the greater good. ""Ah, by the way, the supermarket opens at 8. I""m gonna get there at around 7 so that I could avoid the crowd."" Saitama said, as Genos nodded. ""Copy that."" the cyborg answered as he set up an internal alarm to wake up at exactly 6 am tomorrow. As the two heroes went back to their own businesses, a loud knock from the apartment""s door disturbed them. Saitama was about to get up reluctantly when Genos instantly stood up. ""It""s King-san, sensei."" he said as he walked towards the door and opened it. Saitama was a bit amazed with Genos"" ability. He realized how good Dr. Stench is. The moment the door opened, King instantly walked towards Saitama and held the hero by the shoulders. Somehow, he knew what King was going to say next. ""Saitama-bro. The article. Is it-"" ""Nope, it isn""t"" Saitama answered nonchalantly. He was getting tired of all these questions. He wouldn""t be surprised if Bang visited him to ask the same damn question. After a few seconds when King entered his apartment, another knock was heard. Genos opened the door once more to reveal Bang. Saitama wanted to slam his head on the table for even thinking about it. ""Saitama-"" ""Tatsumaki and I are not dating."" he said flatly, getting a bit annoyed now. On the other hand, the martial artist blinked. ""What are you talking about? I""m here to hand you your wagyu beef."" Bang said as he handed Saitama a paper bag. The hero could only mutter an ""oh"" as he accepted the said bag. ""Thanks man."" he said as he stood up and stored the beef in his refrigerator. ""So you two really aren""t dating-"" ""Good god, Bang. We are not. We""re friends. That""s it."" Saitama said. He should""ve known that Bang was informed about the article too. On the other hand, the older hero simply nodded. ""I see."" he muttered. ""You two are still getting to know each other. It""s a bit too fast if you two would be together-"" ""Let""s just drop the topic altogether, shall we?"" Saitama said as he went back to his manga. Meanwhile, King could only snicker internally. The sudden aversion of the issue. A classic. ""Sensei, whoever it is that you wish to form a romantic relationship with, I will fully support-"" ""I said let""s drop it."" Tatsumaki sat down in her living room""s sofa, hugging her knees to her chest.",2750536
1216,"""There""s nothing here but old papers and books,"" Serenity said, losing interest. ""Paper""s and books?"" Yami asked excitedly. ""Of course! Perhaps there""s something to explain this all in my Grandfather""s journal."" he said, taking the book from his pocket. For the next few hours, he read aloud from the old book. It""s contents were so technical, it put both Joegore and his sister to sleep. As Yami reached the last page, and read it""s marvelous secrets, he slammed the book shut, and jumped from his seat. ""Yes!"" he cried. ""IT CAN BE DONE!!!"" he shouted, raising his arm up in a fist, his eyes widening with a look of madness. Outside, lightening flashed, and thunder clapped, and the portrait of Yami""s grandfather smiled wickedly. Act Two: Scene Three. The next morning, Yami paced about the kitchen as Serenity and Joegore stuffed their faces. The house keeper brought in more tasty local delicacies, and laid the local news paper on the table. ""Good Doctor,"" the housekeeper said, ""Won""t you please sit down and eat breakfast?"" ""Yeah master,"" Joegore said as he shoveled more food into his mouth, ""This stuff""s pretty good."" ""I can""t,"" Yami said, ""I must figure it out. My grandfather""s notes say it can be done, but how? In order for his research to prove true... The only way that this can be done, is if we use the body of someone young, strong, and perfectly fit. And no one like that dies naturally."" ""Maybe this""ll help,"" Serenity said, looking at the paper, ""They""re hanging a foreigner today for murder. Let""s see... 18 years old, no family or friends, and in pretty good shape. It""s he hast to hang. He""s pretty cute,"" she said looking at the picture of the felon. ""Maybe I could go on a conjugal visit...."" ""The only person you""re gonna go visit today is aunt Sophie,"" Joegore said. ""No,"" Yami interjected, ""We need her here. She must prep the lab while you and I steal this body."" ""Steal the body!?"" Joegore exclaimed. ""SSHHHH!"" Yami warned. ""Well, okay,"" Joegore said, ""But you better be paying me extra for this."" ""Right, now hurry,"" Yami said, ""We""ve no time to waste. We must be ready before sunset, when he hangs."" ""What we gonna need?"" Joegore asked. ""We""ll need a horse, a buggy...and a brain,"" Yami said rather dramatically. ""A brain?"" Joegore said loudly. ""What""s he need a brain for? He""s already got one."" ""I do not want the brain of a murderer in my creation,"" Yami said. ""It must be an intelligent brain. Perhaps a doctor, or philosopher."" ""Like Professor Maximillion Pegasus?"" Serenity asked. ""Isn""t he still alive?"" Joegore asked. ""Nope, died last night,"" Serenity said, flipping to the obituaries. The departed Prof. Had apparently suffered a heart attack, and his priceless brain was being preserved at the local science museum. ""Perfect!"" Yami cried. ""Let""s go!"" Act Two: Scene Four. After a quick trip to the graveyard that night to fetch the body, Yami slipped a spare key to Joegore. ""You know what to do?"" Yami asked Joegore. Then, after a double take, he asked, ""Wasn""t your hump on the other side?"" ""What hump?"" Joegore asked. ""The hump on your back.""",512464
458,"Come on you""ve heard of my past life haven""t you Ardeth. The story of a young girl caught between good and wrong and fighting for both sides. I killed myself after Imhotep, and my mother, died by going back to reincarnate them in this very tomb, but yet I was young then. Now though I""m a grown adult, and have brought them back without the Medji killing me before I could even set foot on the ground like my past life had been,"" Jamila said with a wicked smirk on her face. ""You are just as wicked and corrupted as you were when you were a child back then Jamila,"" Ardeth hissed unsheathing his sword and holding it by his side. ""I know, and that""s how I fooled you,"" Jamila smirked before she then yelled to the guards to attack. With that single order the guards swarmed the Medji within a matter of no time. Not a single Medji was left to fight the three of them. Jamila grabbed the black book, and stuffed it into her bag as well as the rest of her things. Without even a single worry, the three of them, and the group of priests, easily made their way out of the temple; up to the surface. When they emerged she found her horse chained to a pillar; more than likely it was the Medji""s doing. Jamila walked over to him and patted the creature on the nose as she whispered, ""I""m sorry boy but I can""t take you with me, hopefully if they don""t kill all the Medji one will take you in."" Grabbing the saddlebag off of the animal, she threw it over her shoulder, and made her way over to the others. By the time the soldiers emerged from the ruins they looked beaten up, but still fit to continue on. However, without warning, the Medji leapt out of the ruins as well still brandishing their, and inching to finish this fight. Pfft heroes! ""Imhotep get us out of here,"" Jamila ordered fearfully, and with that the sand moved around the priests, guards, and the three of them. It was almost a like the sand storm came out of nowhere, and the Medji had to stand back while shielding their eyes from it. However, just as it came it went, and there, where the group had been standing... there was no one. Ardeth stood there shaking his head in rage at their failure to stop this crisis before it had gotten out of hand. Now he could only hope it wouldn""t get any worse. Feeling a tap upon his shoulder by another Medji like himself, he turned to him as he asked, "" What are we going to do now?"" Ardeth scowled bitterly as he answered, ""I have to go to England and see the O""Connell family about this. No doubt they""ll target them, before it""s all over. Until then keep the men safe."" Looking over at the abandon horse, he then added, ""Take the horse back to camp, and care for it. I think her intention all along was to leave it for us anyway."" With that said, Ardeth got on his horse and galloped away toward Cairo where a train would leave and take him far enough to catch a boat. From there he would ride the ship all the way to Turkey where he would then catch a non-stop plane to England.",806976
1239,"""What the fuck is with all these questions? Someone""s going to die if I don""t get a medic from Konoha soon!"" Sasuke finally released Suigetsu. ""Who""s dying?"" ""Hey! Young man!"" All three ninjas turned to an old man on their left who sold fruits and vegetables. He looked around as if expecting to find someone before turning to the white-haired male. ""Where""s your pink-haired friend?"" ""Sorry old man,"" Suigetsu answered with a grimace. ""Sakura""s not well today."" The old man took one tomato from the pile and held it up. ""I even got fresh tomatoes for her. She really loves them."" ""Next time-URGH!"" Suigetsu""s eyes narrowed angrily as he found himself being harshly shoved against the wall by Sasuke, an arm on his neck. The Uchiha""s eyes were wide, ""What did you say?"" he asked slowly. ""What the fuck is wrong with you Sasuke?!"" ""What was her name?!"" Sasuke growled as he shoved his arm deeper on the white-haired male""s neck. ""Who?! Sakura?"" he snapped. ""We don""t even know what her real name is ""cause she couldn""t remember anything!"" Sasuke""s eyes were burning wildly and Suigetsu was taken aback-was that fear? ""What does she look like?"" he asked hollowly. ""A woman about twenty years of age.. P-pink hair...green eyes.."" Sasuke was gone in an instant. Juugo leapt into a fighting stance as the door violently opened, the wood shuddering in its frame. His red orange eyes widened as he recognized the tall form of the intruder. ""Sasuke? What are you doing here?"" Juugo asked as he lowered his fists. ""Where is she?"" he asked and his eyes fell on the pale, sickly form of a woman with pink hair lying on the bed. Carefully, he walked closer until he was at the edge of the bed and dropped to his knees, his now black eyes wide with fear. ""Sakura.."" Juugo watched wordlessly at Team Hebi/Taka""s former leader""s uncharacteristic actions. ""You know her?"" The door shuddered on its frame again as Suigetsu and even Karin appeared. The white-haired male was panting heavily as he angrily grabbed the high collar of Sasuke""s white shirt. ""What the hell do you want?! Do you know her?!"" Sasuke removed Suigetsu""s hand from his shirt. ""Of course, I know her."" Suigetsu""s anger subsided a little. ""Oh really? Then she""s a missing shinobi from Konoha?"" ""Yes."" Suigetsu whipped his head to a cowering Karin hiding behind the door his purple eyes glinting maliciously. ""What the fuck Karin! You said there were no missing reports from Konoha!"" Juugo hesitantly approached the black-haired male, ""When we found her, she doesn""t remember anything. Do you perhaps know her name?"" Sasuke reached out and took Sakura""s clammy hand in his. He fingered the golden band on her ring finger and raised his own hand with the identical ring for the other three ninjas to see. ""Her name is Uchiha Sakura. She""s my wife."" Juugo""s eyes widened and Suigetsu""s jaw dropped as he moved backwards, the back of his knee hitting the bedside table, causing the cup of hot-now cold-tea to shatter to the ground. And Happy birthday, Sasuke-kun! :) Thank you for reading! Please do review! :D Happy Day 24 everyone!",560480
1342,"For meals like breakfast and dinner all inhabitants sat in the Long Hall, but for lunch Zelda and her father took it together ins a smaller room. They used o take this time to talk together, for the princess had been very close with her father. But not lately, and this worried the king. ""Zelda?"" King Daphnese asked. She didn""t look up. ""Zelda, what is wrong my child?"" ""Nothing, father"" she mumbled. ""Zelda,"" the king said, as sternly as he could with her, ""My eyes may be old, but they are not blind. You rarely eat, speak, or smile. And Winsick is more aware than you think, for she has told me of your night terrors. And frankly, I am hurt that you saw me unfit to confide in."" Zelda looked down, ashamed of herself. ""You aren""t unfit, Father,"" she said. ""It""s just.... You have never had visions. You would not understand."" ""I understand that you are troubled,"" King Daphnese said. ""I understand that none have heard you laugh in so long it brings sadness to the entire castle. And you are my dearest child, Zelda. I may be a boring old dud, but I love you and will help you as best I can."" Zelda couldn""t help but let a little smile slip. Her father laughed, and said, ""Now there is the Zelda I know."" ""Very well,"" Zelda sighed, her spirits lifting. ""I will tell you what I""ve seen."" She told him everything about the nightmares that plagued her life. The King sat and listened to every word, and to everything his daughter could think of that could explain the dream. When she finished, he got up, came round to her, and placed a fatherly hand on her shoulder. ""This is indeed a very troubling dream,"" King Daphnese said, ""Sadly, I can neither decipher it or tell you if it is true. But I will say this: many times a dream is just a dream. And for all our sakes, I hope this is just a dream. When did it begin?"" ""Around the time grandmother died,"" Zelda answered. The King smiled. ""Then maybe it is an ordinary dream. Your grief and sorrow at losing your grandmother so young must have manifested itself in your mind. And perhaps it is also being prompted by your upcoming birthday?"" Maybe he was right. Zelda had been so confused and frightened that she had nearly forgotten her sixteenth birthday was next week. Her father had been planning the tournament and ball from the week after her fifteenth birthday. ""You will finally be of age to be officially named heir,"" her father said, ""And to begin looking for a suitable husband. Maybe one of the knights and warriors from the tournament will catch your eye?"" ""Father!"" she exclaimed, blushing. ""Then it is settled,"" he said jollily. ""Chase all thoughts of this nightmare form you mind and let the world see your shining, happy face once more."" and with that, he bowed and left to attend more pressing businesses of state. Yet, as Zelda allowed a servant to come and take the plate away, she could not shake the nagging feeling in her mind. ""Miss,"" the girl taking her plate said, ""Forgive me for having eavesdropped, but perhaps my grandmother could help you?"" ""Who is your grandmother?"" Zelda asked the girl.",512464
2572,"It does bother me."" Sakura laughed, ""I""ll just have to fix it later."" ""Later,"" Sasuke agreed as he pressed his lips against her palm. Later. Because they have their whole lives ahead of them, as husband and wife. I hope you caught the reference to Prompt 4 :D Because the whole story really heavily comes back to the first few prompts. Everything is interrelated. The next one will be the epilogue! I can""t believe we""ve reached this point already. Thank you, thank you so much for all the support! This would not have been possible without all of you! Finally, the Epilogue :D Enjoy! Prompt 31: Three Wishes When his son, Uchiha Itachi, was born, Sasuke took him gently into his arms and gazed at his soft black hair, black eyes and little nose that reminded him of Sakura. His chest filled with pride and his lips stretched into a grateful smile. At that moment, Sasuke wished that his son would grow up strong and wise like his namesake. This was why at a tender age of three, Sasuke gifted his son with a set of kunai, much to the chagrin of his wife, Sakura, and patiently taught the boy how to use them. At age five, he was already watching with stern eyes as his son performed a perfect Katon: Gokakyu no Jutsu. At age seven, he and his wife attended their son""s Academy graduation. Itachi had finished at the top of his class, and-as what Sakura giggled beside him, her green eyes bright with mischief-also conquered the hearts of his female classmates, possibly without meaning to do so. Inwardly, he smirked. Of course. With him and Sakura as the boy""s parents, it was expected. Uchiha Itachi stood in front of his father, his small hands holding his newly acquired Konoha forehead protector. ""Father!"" the young boy said excitedly, because while he resembled Sasuke physically and in strength, the boy took on his mother""s personality. ""I am finally a genin!"" Sasuke""s own father would have given a curt nod, and a cold ""As expected of my son"" remark. But Sasuke wasn""t his father. Instead, he took the forehead protector, knelt in front of his son and secured the Konoha shinobi symbol on Itachi""s forehead. His son was grinning in embarrassment as he muttered, ""You didn""t have to, father."" Sasuke gave his little boy-no, he was a shinobi now-a nod of approval as he ruffled his hair. ""I am proud of you, son."" When her son, Uchiha Itachi, was born, Sakura placed a gentle kiss on his forehead, stroked his-thankfully- turf of black hair and nuzzled his small nose. At that moment, Sakura wished that her son would grow up well-loved in a tightly-knit family, like the one she once had and like the one his father longed for. Between Sasuke and her, Sakura was the more caring one, tending to her son""s cuts and bruises after an afternoon of rigorous training with his father. She approached the boy with a smile, offering a clean towel, her hands already glowing green as she worked through his injuries.",560480

""You sound just as corny as dad does,"" Brand said, disgusted. ""Dad tells me the truth,"" Mikey told him. ""And you know what he said? He said One-Eyed Willy had been down there for years. They were digging tunnels and caves, setting booty traps-"" ""Booby traps,"" Data interjected. ""That""s what I said, booby traps, so anybody who tried to get in would die. Then he killed all his men, so they wouldn""t get his treasure."" ""Yeah, wait a minute, Mikey,"" Chunk said. ""If Willy killed all his men, then how did the map or the story get out?"" ""Yeah, my dad says that one of the guys must have gotten out with the map, and-"" ""Hey, Mikey, I believe you,"" Chunk said hastily. ""I don""t believe you at all,"" Mouth said. He was gearing up for an argument about Mikey""s stupid story. Pirates and treasure- that was all grade school stuff. He glanced at Elle to see if she was really buying into his story. She was poring over the map, tracing the routes with her finger. She was muttering nonstop under her breath. ""Guys, come on! We should do it. It would take care of all my dad""s debts, and we wouldn""t have to leave the Goon Docks!"" Mikey said. ""Come on, Mike,"" Chunk groaned. ""I don""t wanna go on another one of your Goonie adventures."" Elle bristled and opened her mouth to say that the map might be authentic, but then the doorbell rang. Everyone jumped a foot in the air at the sudden noise. Once the shock had ebbed away they raced each other down the stairs to the door. ""Guys!"" Mikey cried. ""Where""re you going? You don""t want to do this?"" He picked up the map. Elle toted a strange stone doubloon that had come with the map, heaved herself up, and carefully limped down the stairs. Everyone burst through the screen door and onto the front porch. ""Jerk alert,"" Mouth moaned. There were two men dressed in matching trenchcoats and hats. Black umbrellas shielded them from the rain. ""Can I help you?"" Brand asked. They looked pleasently surprised to see them. ""Well, hello little guys. I""m Mr. Perkins. Troy""s father,"" he added for some reason. ""We know Troy, he""s a cheap guy,"" Data said disgustedly. ""My dad""s not home, Mr. Perkins,"" Brand sighed. ""Is your mommy here?"" he asked in a slow voice, as though addressing five year olds. ""No, she""s down at the market buying Pampers for all us kids,"" Brand said sarcastically. Mr. Perkins forced a chuckle. ""Papers,"" he muttered to his cohort. ""Well, can you give these papers for your father to read through and sign? We""ll be by to pick them up in the morning,"" Mr. Perkins held up a stack of different colored papers. ""Thank you,"" Brand said, taking them. ""Thank you,"" Mr. Perkins said, the barest hint of a grin on his face. ""What is that?"" Mikey asked his brother as he came back to the porch. ""Dad""s business,"" Brand said gruffly. ""But what is it?"" ""I told you, it""s Dad""s business!"" Brand repeated. Then he looked at the retreating figures of Mr. Perkins and his friend.",2855986
510,"Lion-O stalked his prey, but Mumm-Ra cried out, ""You are the better cat. So why is it that your forced to bow to that arrogant brother of yours? Join me Lion-O, and together we can rule and you will have all you desire."" Lion-O spoke the absolute truth, which he finally saw fully, ""I compete with my brother, but I""ve never been against him."" And with those final words, Lion-O finished off Mumm-Ra. His guide sword bowed to him with a flourish in a sign of respect. Lion-O was barely able to take a breath between victory being declared and the King""s arrival. After practically leaping off his stead, Tygra immediately asked, ""Where is Cheetara?"" When Lion-O didn""t answer in the breath Tygra allowed him, the King jumped to the worst conclusion, ""She died. Oh gods, was it horrible? Don""t tell me. No, tell me. I should""ve been here. I could""ve protected her. Somehow."" ""I""m right here."" Cheetara said, awake again, though she was supporting most of her weight on Panthro""s helping frame. Tygra wasted no time, taking her and embracing her quickly, not caring they were in public. ""You were right. I should""ve never separated us. It was ten times worse, but I was so sure Mumm-Ra would seek me out. I just wanted you away from the worst danger."" Cheetara just smiled, ""When will you learn I""m always right?"" Tygra frowned, ""Now, don""t get cocky."" Lion-O sensed whatever had come between them before had been forgotten. Tygra looked around and smiled at his brother and looked around at the beaten, but held wall, ""I""m impressed, Lion-O. You really have grown-up."" He lowered his voice, ""You would make a great king."" They were the words Lion-O had so longed to hear from his brother. Many others began to praise Lion-O for his defeat of Mumm-Ra and it felt like hours before he spotted his brother and Cheetara again. They were hidden away, whispering softly to each other and embracing gently. Lion-O snarled his lip and let his tongue hang out in disgust. He spotted the guide and was curious despite himself, ""What are they saying?"" ""Secrets whispered between lovers aren""t meant for the prickly ears of the nosy."" She answered, her back straight and her eyes looking off into the distance. ""I""m beginning to hate you."" The battle won, Tygra took his place as king before his subjects. He raised his arms for quiet and almost instantly the joyous crowds grew silent. Their king smiled, ""The day is ours and Mumm-Ra is defeated."" Cries of joy filled the air once again. Tygra let the moment continue until the roars quieted again. ""The Evil Demon shall haunt us no more. Thanks to the sacrifices and bravery to all of those here and those no longer with us."" He paused for a solemn moment. ""A new age has dawned as a dark chapter of our history closes forever. And as we stand here together, there is one I would like to thank above all others, Prince General Lion-O. Join me, brother."" He stretched out his hand to Lion-O, who nearly stumbled making his way to the King. Tygra began to circle around his younger sibling, still crying out to the gathered crowd. ""But how should I reward you?",1497577

Our gazes locked and he could see the guilt in mine, while I could see the sadness in his. ""I""m sorry, Matt. It""s not like I have control..."" ""I know, but he does,"" Matt growled as his eyes took on anger. He closed his eyes, and somehow managed to pull me in even closer. I sat there for a while as I listened to his breathing finally even out. It was then that I realized that both boys were trying to win my heart. That both boys were jealous of one another.

We must save all the wonderful cookies. LOL Okay so I know it""s been like the longest time, so please don""t kill me. I""ve been really busy with school, and I""ve had serious writers block lately. Besides my remote for my DVD player decided to go on the fritz for a while so it was hard to pause the movie and type down all that they were saying without using the subtitles. Anyway I hope you enjoy my best attempt on a new chapter. Thanks to all my reviewers that gave me the push to write more on this story, - Raine44354... Kisa-Amane... ShortLILPunk... MCMelMel...

Disclaimer- I do not own any of the characters in the movie ""The Haunting in Connecticut,' but I do own Shay, Steve, Diego, and Kathryn and anybody else you realize wasn""t in the movie. +Discovery+ The next little couple of days were pure hell, not for me, but for Matt. He had gone for one of his treatments and it seemed almost as if it was making him sicker. He was often in the bathroom either throwing up or he was in the bed fast asleep. I often watched over him until sleep would finally take hold of me, and then I would be haunted by Jonah as he desperately reached out to me for comfort. Never would he talk, he""d only touch, love, and devour me until I broke away before anything serious would happen. Then I""d wake up feeling as tired as I did before and even more confused. Sara""s relationship with Peter was becoming strained as I often caught her arguing with him over the phone about money, or something or another.",806976
546,"Surprisingly Omiko completely, Takaharu""s vocal power was so overwhelming that he managed to cause her hair to blow back from the force. When he was all said and done, Omiko was left speechless, and Takaharu just stood motionless in front of her. Finally, the boxer sighed. ""I thought that because we were outside Honnōji Academy, we could at least pretend we weren""t always at each other""s throats. I know how much you care about the Tennis Club, Hakodate-san. You care about it just as much as I care about the Boxing Club."" he admitted with sincerity. It became quickly obvious that Omiko didn""t have the heart to throw a snide comment at him in response. In fact, Omiko was so taken aback by his sudden sincerity, that she felt her cheeks flushing hot pink. Unable to fully control herself, the girl pulled down her cap and turned away as she sort of muttered a response. ""Well, uh, I guess...I guess you have a point. You should just say stuff like that up front, you know."" she seemed to demand, and luckily, Takaharu seemed to lighten up in response. He then proceeded to ask her a question no one had ever asked before. ""Do you live far from here, Hakodate-san? I could walk with you every once in awhile. If Tennis Club and Boxing Club get out at the same time, that is."" he suggested, much to the twin-tailed girl""s surprise. She almost choked on her words, before somehow regaining her composure. ""I""m just...just down this alley. I""m at complex 4567."" Takaharu""s face lit up again at the coincidence. ""Really? I""m at 4569. We""re almost right next to each other."" Omiko simply grumbled before looking away again. ""Yeah, I guess so."" What was his deal, she wondered. The fact that he was being nice seemed to annoy her much more than when he was being competitive, but for some reason, Omiko couldn""t just tell him to go away. It was the worst kind of torture, having her being nice to him. Omiko was sure that it was some plot to mess with her when she least expected it. ""It sure will be nice when we finally get to One-Stars. We""ll have Goku Uniforms, and they""ll give us a really nice apartments."" Takaharu commented next to Omiko, as they walked along towards her numbered living space. ""That""ll be the day..."" she replied, her voice trailing off at the end as she imagined the possibilities. She""d be a One-Star soon enough. She knew it as a fact. Omiko looked back at Takaharu, and noted the pleasant expression on his face. Now the real question was: would he be a One-Star as well? Truth be told, as long as she was one first, then it wouldn""t really matter if he earned the uniform or not. But one thing was for sure. If he stood in her way, nice or not, then he would be swept aside like an incoming tennis ball. It didn""t matter that he was acting like her friend. It didn""t matter that the very thought of having a friend made her feel warm inside. And it certainly didn""t matter that up until this point, Omiko had never really had friends. What mattered most to her was that One-Star Uniform, and no one, Takaharu included, was going to stop her from that lofty goal.",967934

I don""t want you to hurt!"" Akane then says, ""Umm...""The Girlman""...I want to help you!"" Girlman then silently leaves her to fight the other clowns while Akane battle the others and then she sees a poodle lady with her poodle trying to attack Akane, but Akane pulls out a piece of BBQ chicken and tosses it so the poodle runs off and Akane then goes up to her and goes...""boo"" and the poodle lady runs off. Girlman then sees four clowns making off with the money and then Girlman throws his/her ""girl-a-rang"" and it knocks out the four clowns, Then Girlman manages to grab the money and tosses it to Akane while Girlman continues to fight off the rest of the gang.

But then Soun sees Girlman make his/her exit by pulling out a grappling hook and exiting the area. Soon, Ranma shows up and goes up to Soun and says, ""It""s a shame I missed the charity, what with what just happened, oh and Mr. Tendo here""s a little something for the kids and ""Weird Al""."" Ranma then placed a four thousand dollars in the collection and then Soun says, ""How generous of you Mister Saotome, now if only your parents were still around...oh and by the way, before he died, your father and I arranged a marriage between you and my lovely daughter Akane and she will live with you at Saotome Manor, by the way how is Kasumi doing as your maid?""

The boy is followed by two black-haired girls who wear pale white masks and long green robes.",910821
572,"She picked out a ring with a pretty pink stone."" Hunt took another sip and took a deep breath before continuing. ""I thought it was a sapphire, an expensive one, but I thought it was a sapphire. Until she started talking about our engagement in the car, if I""d known she was looking at pink diamonds I would""ve steered her away."" Sloan was confused. ""Don""t they label them? Didn""t you see the label?"" ""I was looking at her, not the jewelry. I only wanted out of the doghouse! I didn""t want to marry her, but you can""t really take that back. I was driving home trying to think of a way out if it, and there just isn""t one. I swear, I was the only guy in Iraq who was hoping his girl would cheat on him, so I""d have an easy out. I always knew I wasn""t going to marry her, but couldn""t figure out how to make-up for that pain. Only to realize there is no way."" ""I slept with my best friend""s wife."" Hunt looked to Sloan, the beer slowing his brain and needed an extra minute to remember the beginning of the night. When he finally nodded in understanding, Sloan continued, ""The man who was closer than a brother to me and I slept with his wife, even fell in love with her. There is no forgiving that. Not really. I mean we""re good now because he has Meredith, but the trust, it""ll never be like it used to."" Hunt waited for him to continue, and Sloan took another drink. ""I was always the screw-up, where he was always perfect. Even when he had problems and acted like a complete ass, he was perfect and I was the screw-up. Though I have my theories, I can only guess as to why he punched me, but I know why I punched him back."" Both men took a drink, enjoying the filling beer slide down their throats as they sat together in silence lost in their memories. The bar had filled since they first came in, and the noise covered any lapses in conversation. Mark was the one to break it. ""I could really go for some chicken wings right now, Buffalo style."" Owen looked up. ""Me too."" He checked the time at the bar. ""Doubt the kitchen""s still open here though."" ""Damn."" Mark finished his drink and brought back down on the table, hard. Owen finished his drink as well, but lowered his glass with much less force. He started to put on his coat. ""Come on, I know a place that has the best wings in Seattle, and it""s open late."" Mark started to put on his own jacket as Owen called a cab. They began to make their way to the door, in a not quite straight line. Mark pointed a finger at Owen, wanting to make something clear, ""I""m from New York, it""s going to take a lot to impress me."" Owen saw Mark stagger and put his hand on his arm to steady the other man, much like he did after the fight. ""Oh, you might be surprised with Seattle."" A/N: I wrote nothing that is italized. Vows Preston Burke looked over his vows for the woman he was about to marry for the hundredth time. He changed a sentence and read them again. He felt like starting over once more. Christina, I could promise to hold you and to cherish you. He""d written his vows for Cristina in one shot.",1497577
3158,"And so Edna""s parents and Eric end up driving to Townsville as Edna and Junior wait for Edna""s guest to arrive. Suddenly, Edna hears a knock at the door so she gets up and sees Princess in her ""Ariel"" form. Princess then asks Edna, ""Can ""Puppy Dog"" come out and play? Edna then replies, ""Well he""s having breakfast, you can come back later ok?"" Princess just smiles and walks back to her room. Courage Jr. just finished his can and asks Edna, ""So what""s the plan for the day Edna?"" Edna replies, ""Well Junior I have a friend from school coming over and then we""re gonna watch a show called ""Survivor: Albonquetine"". It""s where a Girl from Manhattan named Michelene or ""Mike"" has to compete with a self-appointed island princess named Lu and Lu""s Cousin the boy-genius named Og over who survives on Albonquetine without being voted off. Then they hear a knock at the door. Courage Jr. opens the door and he sees a young girl who is Edna""s age. She is has short pink hair with pale skin, and is wearing silver boots, pink pants, purple shirt and silver jacket. She looks at Courage Jr. with her blue eyes and smiles. Edna then shows up and greets her, ""Hiya ""boss""!"" The two giggle and then she says to Junior, ""Oh this is the editor-in-chief at the ""The Dilly Planet"" at John R. Dilworth Elementary, isn""t that right Chief?"" The girl replies, ""Don""t call me ""Chief""! The name""s Ebe, Ebe Adamski! I""m from Roswell, New Mexico!"" Ebe then looks at Courage Jr. and hugs him as she asks Edna, ""Hey Edna, is this the dog you keep talking about that saves your hide from all sorts of nasty creatures of darkness?"" Edna picks up Junior and replies, ""Yep! He also leads a group of good monsters to protect people and this city from bad monsters as well."" Ebe then pets him and says, ""Hello little dog, nice to finally meet you, so have you ever dealt with... aliens?"" Junior replies, ""Yep Ebe, it was the ghost of the alien chicken my father faced years ago. It seems that he wanted to go after my pop but he couldn""t find him... so he went for me instead, fortunately I had help in the form of my ghost friend Hanako, and that""s how we became friends. Ebe writes everything down and she comments, ""Oh so you befriended the legendary ghost from the girls bathroom of our school huh, such a amazing feat."" Junior then replies, ""Yep, turns out she was a lonely and friendly ghost and helped her solve both those problems, my other friend is the Yokai named Manta, a polite two tailed cat and the second friend I made and he helped me big time against my dad""s nemesis ""The Queen of the Black Puddle""... however I discovered she has a daughter who is her polar opposite and due to her love of animals and the human world she refuses to be evil, so she wanted to be my friend and the rest is history. Edna then says to Junior, ""Don""t forget to tell Ebe how you met Izzy and Chowder Jr."" However Junior looks outside and notices the unusually colored rain. Courage Jr. then asks Edna, ""Umm does Somewhere have a history of purple rain?"" Edna replies, ""No but Prince has a history with ""Purple Rain"".""",910821
2137,"Through gritted teeth he asked, ""What are you talking about?"" Dick chuckled before turning serious. ""You""re the great detective, figure it out. You do have feelings, Bruce, and they do get in the way. Or have you really not noticed that your girlfriend is a little strange?"" The line went dead, but it took moments for Bruce to actually hang up the phone. He looked up to Selina, doubts and thoughts swirling in his head. She merely smiled as if nothing had changed, which from her side of the desk, nothing had. Bruce envied her for that. ""Troubles at home?"" Bruce pushed his treacherous thoughts away, acting as if though nothing of importance had happened on that phone call. ""Dick""s impossible."" She laughed, leaning back in her chair. ""He""s a teenager, Bruce. All teenagers are impossible."" He still looked gloomy, so she continued her laughter. ""I hate to be the one to break it to you, Bruce, but that cute puppy you picked up from the pound does eventually grow up into a troublesome dog."" Bruce needed a distraction and got out the checkbook. ""Who do I make it out to?"" Selina seemed a bit confused. ""We have more to go over, Bruce. Like what kind of publicity do you want?"" Bruce had to get her out, ""I leave it entirely to your discretion."" She cocked her head slightly and furrowed her brow, like a cat his mind unhelpfully supplied, ""Are you okay?"" He put on his best disarming smile. ""I""m great."" He wrote the check, and handed it to a perplexed Selina. ""Listen, Selina, I""m sorry I have to cut this short, but I really have to get back to that meeting. Lucius was really upset by me leaving."" He stood. ""I""ll escort you to the door."" Selina studied him carefully as she walked out with him. And though she didn""t ask the words, Bruce could feel her questions. What""s wrong with you? Are you all right? What did Dick say that upset you so much? When she got to the door, she paused holding up the check with two fingers, ""Seriously, Bruce, this is a big check. There""s absolutely no place you have in mind? You just want it to go to any local Gotham charity?"" Bruce thought quickly for a moment. ""Give it to someone who will do the most good with it."" ""Okay."" Selina thought for a moment and then got a look on her face that Bruce had to compare a cat that""d caught a canary. ""I have the perfect place for your money."" Suddenly, Bruce didn""t trust this woman who he""d let so far into his life. She smiled once more before leaving. ""Good-bye, Prince of Gotham."" He imagined that those words had the same intonation as Catwoman""s ""Sweet dreams, Dark Knight."" As soon as she was out the door, Bruce went straight to his closet, intent on following her. He couldn""t get Dick""s accusation out of his head. He began to change his business suit, assuming she""d stay in the upper, rich, part of the city. He lost the tie, gained a sweater vest and changed his pants and shoes. He then grabbed a side satchel he would never dream of using, throwing in a hooded sweatshirt and another set of pants in case she surprised him.",1497577
966,"When sleeping heroes awaken, When foundations of stone are shaken, When the voiceless maiden sings, When the last bell of Midnight rings, When, for love, the dying thief speaks his last word And the warrior""s spawn at last takes up the sword, The Land of Lodoss, cursed from birth, Born from the goddesses"" mirth, Shall either rise like the Phoenix in flight, Or descend to Death, in the darkest night... Chapter One: Magnus: The Wandering Half-elf The desert city of Flame was teeming. Merchants peddling their wares, knights and squires conversing with their comrades in the streets, and villagers walking to and fro, living their daily lives. About what one would expect from a castle town. Those were Magnus""s thoughts as he walked over the drawbridge, pass the city gates. Women started noticing him at once. He hated his ears now more than ever! Why did his Elven blood have such an effect on people? All he wanted was to fit in- that""s the whole reason he left his mother and the village. Magnus sighed. Oh well. Perhaps his good looks and strange ears would attract some business. He scanned the street corners for a place to set up. Magnus was a musician. Hard to believe, considering who his parents were. Truth be told, Magnus hated fighting and war. He found sword play and other such combat barbaric. He preferred the healing sounds of music. Especially on his fiddle. Yes, the tall, lean half Elven man played the fiddle. Of all instruments, he felt that this one alone could express his inner soul. Then, he saw it! The perfect place for a minstrel to play and attract an audience. He took the fiddle off his back, took the bowstring from his belt- where it lay next to his dagger - he was a pacifist, but not stupid - and started to sit down in the spot. ""Hey!"" cried a high little voice, ""Watch it, you big behemoth!"" Magnus spun around, and on the ground in the spot sat what at first glance was a little boy, dressed in green and white. But then Magnus saw the ears and realized that this was a sprite. ""Oops,"" Magnus said, scratching his head, ""Sorry. I didn""t see you there, little guy."" ""No one ever sees the little guy,"" the sprite said. He looked up at Magnus, smiled, and said, ""My name""s Maar. Maar the Bard."" Magnus took Maar""s hand and said, ""I""m Magnus. Nice to meet you. Is it alright if I sit here with you and play music together?"" ""With the competition?"" Maar asked, aghast, ""I have a living to earn, pal!"" ""I""ll share the profits with you, I promise,"" Magnus said. ""I""m also a starving artist, but I""d gladly share with a fellow musician."" Maar stared at Magnus a moment, perplexed. Magnus knew this look. Others who didn""t believe his kindness and sincerity often stared at him like that. But then, Maar smiled once more and said, ""Alright, but remember your promise."" ""I will, Maar,"" Magnus said. Maar stood up, and retrieved a small set of pipes from his bag. Magnus stood up and did a few tuning swipes of the bow. ""I""ve only been back for a short time,"" Maar said, ""But I remember some of the popular folk songs here.""",512464
1600,"""My parents would kill me if they knew what I was telling you. Clu... well..."" Fi started at Carey in impatience. ""Well what?"" ""Clu he quit college"" Fi stared at Carey in shock. ""He did what?"" ""He quit college. He said he couldn""t be there anymore, that it was driving him insane"" ""So he just quits?"" ""He said that he felt distant from his family and friends and that he missed you so much"" ""Ah and he hits me with a compliment"" Carey smiled. ""He said he decided to stop going to college that night when you were lost and we found you in the caves. He said that all kind of thoughts were going through his mind when he got the phone call from Jack saying that he didn""t know where you were."" Fi wrinkled her nose and stopped being mad at Clu; she could never be mad at someone who cared so deeply for her. ""Man, your parents are going to freak... especially Irene"" Carey looked at Fi and gave her a knowing look. ""Can we say meltdown?"" Fi laughed and smiled at Carey; out of all the people that was on tour with her she was glad that Carey was here. At times he didn""t believe her but he always followed her no matter what, she loved that about him, he was always so caring. ""Man, can life be anymore confusing?"" Carey looked at Fi and smiled also; he loved the way she was always so curious and always had a mission on her mind. She loved being on the road and when Molly said she wanted to go back home he knew that she was disappointed but kept her mouth quiet for her mother""s benefit. That was Fi, always thinking of Molly first. ""It could be"" Fi and Carey looked up and saw Molly standing in the doorway smiling at them showing her emotions clearly, she had something she wanted to say. ""What""s up mom?"" Fi got up and walked over to her mom and slipped her way into her mom""s arms. ""Hold on a sec sweetie... Clu! Irene! Ned! Jack! Annie! Meet me in Carey""s room now!"" A few seconds later Irene, Ned, Jack, Clu and Annie walked into the room and stared at Molly with confusion in their eyes. ""Yes mom?"" Jack rubbed his eyes. ""I have something to say. I know when Fi was released from the hospital I told you guys that I wanted to come back home to be normal and I knew that most of you wanted to be on tour but kept your mouth shut for my benefit"" Fi and Jack looked at each other and shared a wink. ""But after a lot of thinking I have realized that being on tour is where we belong. So as of now we are back on the tour!"" Fi looked at her mom and smiled big. Clu and Annie shrieked, Irene and Ned sighed and Jack and Carey stood still. ""We""re going back on tour Ms. P? How cool!"" Carey got up and hugged Molly. ""Yep Carey-"" Molly turned to Irene and Ned who were staring at her with surprise in their eyes now. ""I know you guys must be up to here with me changing my mind but how about it?"" Irene smiled; sure she loved being in Hope Springs but she missed being on the tour and being on a cell phone. ""Let""s pack up sweetie."" Annie screamed and pulled Fi out of the room with her. ""This is so cool Fi! We""re going on tour again! I""m so psyched especially since you""re here!",29783
1026,"Although she reflected a bit of spunk and courage of her father, she would look where she would go and leap...reasonable like her mother. Everytime she came to drop by my dorm, she would help me with my assignments and all."" Gale hid his eyes in the fringe of his hair. Only a stream of tears visible in his face. ""I was shocked the first time I heard they disappeared one day, Haru. It seemed that everything just broke down inside of me. I wanted immediately to break out of the house and shout to the whole world of my anguish and sorrow at their loss. But, I also had to mind you. After all, you were their son. You fainted immediately, and I had to disregard myself for a while..."" Haru placed his hands over Gale""s, and felt the slight trembling the blonde had been experiencing. ""Somehow...I regretted being a jerk towards you! I just don""t know whether if it was something between us that prompted them to visit or something, I just don""t know! I...I...feel it was my fault..."" Gale screamed, crying uncontrollably, before bringing his hand to wipe tears that had freely streamed across his face. He was struggling to keep his countenance, but all restraint had shattered...and now, he just felt vulnerable to pain once more. ""Gale..."" The blonde was surprised a bit, as arms encircled from behind him. Warmth took over the coldness that threatened to take him. He felt the heat of flesh from across the thin fabric of his shirt. Silver hair waved softly from beside his cheek. A soft whisper... ""No one""s to blame..."" ""Haru..."" ""Onegai.... I don""t want to cry anymore. And I don""t want you to cry either."" Gale leaned back, tears now slowly subsiding. He clutched one of Haru""s hands, a slight twitch came as response. A slight musk scent came into his attention, and Gale snuggled closer to where it was emanating, not realizing he was on Haru""s neck. Only a soft whisper came...a purr or rumbling of some sort... ""We""ll see them once more...one way or another..."" ""I believe...Haru..."" Gale had immediately left him just as he came. He was still shaken from the things that had happened, but nevertheless had felt that a burden was finally taken away from his shoulders. An hour passed by before each was called to have dinner downstairs. Haru and Gale met at the stairs, their gazes meeting each other, before smiling a bit and proceeding downstairs together. Shuda kept staring at Gale and Haru, who now seemed more cordial and friendly towards each other. Whatever happened to them up stairs, especially that unexpected scream that came from Gale in Haru""s room, Shuda had absolutely no idea what was happening right now. He was just about to speak out his thoughts when Musica timely interrupted him. ""All right, now I""m weirded here. What the hell just happened to both of you?"" Musica placed his fork and spoon down, went over to Haru and checked his temperature, his other hand going to Gale""s forehead as well. ""Nothing...you""re taking things too seriously, Musica-kun.

1501,"He was smart enough to know that in all likelihood it would have no effect on his circumstances aside from leaving him with a sore hand and a scratchy throat, but he had been pissed off. Finally, he had sunk to the floor, head in his hands and dangerously close to tears. Ed hated feeling weak, but as he leaned against the cold wall of the detention center, he couldn""t help it. Life was just so goddamn unfair. Everything that had happened in the past few days, the arrest, his mom-but no, he couldn""t start thinking about that. If he did, Ed wasn""t sure he""d be able to stop. With this in mind, Ed had wiped his cheeks furiously and had taken a few calming breaths. Since then, he""d settled into the stiff mattress of the top bunk and begun counting the small dots on the ceiling tiles, anything to keep his mind busy and off certain thoughts. When that means of distraction was exhausted he""d begun listing the elements of the periodic table in his head. Once he""d finished that he went back through and tried to remember the atomic weight of each element. He was trying to recall whether the weight of Uranium was 238.029 or 237.048 when his thoughts were interrupted by the metal squeaking of the door swinging open. Ed turned his head and watched as someone dressed in the same ill-fitting uniform he was in hopped nimbly from behind the heavy door and entered the room. The boy seemed to be about Ed""s age (albeit a number of inches taller, much to Ed""s chagrin) and was clearly of East Asian descent with a long angular face and lengthy black hair pulled into a low ponytail at the base of his neck. He was smiling, a wide expression that encompassed his entire face. He lifted a hand towards Ed as the door swung shut behind him. ""Hello,"" he said, voice light and calm. ""I""m Ling Yao."" Ed sighed and swung his legs over the side of the bed so he was sitting up, facing the intruder. The boy-Ling-looked at Ed contemplatively, arms crossed casually across his chest as he leaned against the wall adjacent to the door. Once it was clear that Ed had no intention of responding, his eyebrows descended into a more cunning visage. ""And you""re Edward Elric,"" he said, voice taking on a serious lilt. Ed""s forehead furrowed. ""How do you know my name?"" he asked suspiciously. ""I""m your roommate,"" Ling said, shrugging his shoulders. He raised an eyebrow at Ed""s continued silence. ""Surely you didn""t think you got both beds to yourself, did you?"" Still Ed said nothing, simply continued to glare at the strange boy. Although this was his first time at a juvenile detention center, he understood the system well enough to know that it was unlikely that the administration had informed Ling of his name or anything else for that matter. Ling seemed to implicitly understand the other boy""s suspicions and he smiled once more. ""You""re quite the celebrity. Front page of the Times this morning."" Well, I guess Mustang got his article, Ed thought to himself. ""I wasn""t aware the Times had such avid readers in the juvenile correctional system,"" he said. Ling laughed.",2943978
1592,"Joey shook her head and grunted something under her breath causing Dawson to look up, he smiled and waved at Jen who was making her way over to them. ""Be nice Joey"" Joey hit Dawson on the shoulder playfully and waved at Jen once she walked up to them. ""Hey Joey, Dawson. You guy seem awfully cozy"" Jen smiled, showing that she was only playing around. Jen looked at Dawson and then to Joey and saw something between them. ""Where""s Pacey?"" Joey felt her throat dry up at Jen""s question. ""I wouldn""t know he dumped me"" Joey hefted her backpack on her left shoulder and turned to Dawson before leaving. ""Meet you at lunch?"" Dawson nodded, she smiled and walked off to history class. Dawson watched her leave, his eyes watching her for the longest time, they only advanced to Jen once she cleared her throat loudly. ""He dumped her? Why?"" Dawson put his backpack on and bit his bottom lip not knowing how to really describe the whole situation Jen, it was the kind of situation where you had to be there to understand it. ""It""s complicated"" With those two words Dawson walked off towards English class. Jen watched Dawson leave and then turned to Jack who had made his way over to her. ""Oh great. Joey and Dawson are going down that path again."" Jack looked at Jen confused. ""What path?"" Jen pulled Jack with her. ""The path to disaster. They are falling in love with each other again, well they never stopped loving each other but they are going down that path again, they""re going to give their relationship another try"" Dawson looked up at the clock and smiled relieved when he heard the class bell ringing telling him that the class was over. Dawson grabbed his books and practically ran out of science class, he didn""t want someone to ask him to stay back, he just wanted to get out. He had felt Pacey staring at him throughout the whole class, he felt Pacey""s eyes burning a hole in the back of his head. Dawson looked at his watch and smiled again, it was lunchtime. Dawson walked into the cafeteria searching for Joey, he felt his heart skip a beat when he saw her, she was sitting at the cafeteria table that they used to sit at when they were going out, her hair was down from the ponytail and a few strands of her hair fell in her face, she stared down at the lunch. Dawson felt an old feeling enter his body, the feeling he used to have everyday when he used to be with her, he used to count the minutes until lunch, he would practically run out of class and into the cafeteria pushing people out of his way, and he would only stop acting like a maniac when he got to *their* table, it was like it was happening all over again and they weren""t even together. ""Hey there"" Joey looked up from her lunch and smiled big when she saw Dawson. ""Hey"" Dawson sat down next to Joey and pulled out a paper bag. ""You brought your own lunch Dawson? What happened to living through the school lunches because they were a part of the high school experience?"" Dawson took out a peanut and butter sandwich. ""I was a naive boy back then Jo"" Joey cracked a smile and pulled out a paper bag, Dawson laughed.",29783
2751,"Sometimes, I have nightmares but they feel so real that it scares me. I keep telling myself if was only a dream, myimaganation but all the sensations are too real. I""m scared. The days pass by faster now, because I keep dreading the time I finally fall asleep. Will I dream? What will happen this time? I want to know, but I don""t. I want Tsuzuki to save me, but I don""t know how he can. If this keeps going, eventually I""ll never be able to sleep. At that point, I will no longer be able to hide myinsceurties. My stress builds up little my little each day and nothing I have done has provided a releaf for it. Sometimes, when I""m with Tsuzuki, he makes me feel like things will be allright again. Like I""m safe. However, this is just a lie. I don""t feel safe at all. I just feel what he""s feeling. Who am I? Sometimes I can""t even tell anymore. In public, I only focus on Tsuzuki and he guides me through the darkness. Gradually I began to notice that I could no longerseperate my own feelings from his. Do I feel happy at the moment? Or angry? My mind tells me I should feel one way, but I often feel many emotions at once. I think I""m slowly losing it. Barely a month has gone by, and already I feel like my path will lead me to the brink of an endless, cold black hole. Muraki will be coming back for me. If he does not, then he knows that I will go back to him. I have to get to that mansion. If I can""t go back to the person I used to be, then I""m not going to look back on my life. I will give it up. It doesn""t matter if I become his slave or doll, if someone can take this pain away I will gladly serve them until my life is no longer my own. At that point, I""m as good as dead. I will pass on, living in a dream where Tsuzuki and I can be together like it used to be. This must be my minds interpreteration of the illusion fields, a place where one is always happy in the after life. Maybe like heaven, I don""t know. But I can""t go on anymore. I have to go back to my hell. Maybe... this is my penitence for being born and living a failure to my family. I""m begining to think that... maybe, just maybe, my mother was right about me from the start. I left their world and escaped from the pain, if only a little. But now, I""ll be right back where I started and this time, I won""t have a route to escape by. ""It""s irony, I guess, that I would be coming back to the very place I was captured and held by Muraki under another red moon. It""s an unnatural event, out of season, but it must be an omen..."" Hisoka""s voice echoed softly in among the empty, broken down walls of the old mansion. It was typical of a horror like setting, but for a house that hasn""t been cared for in centuries, some dilapidation is expected to occur. Regret filled Hisoka""s mind as he walked through the house. He had left Tsuzuki behind without warning. He made sure that his partner was preoccupied, even if it felt like the wrong thing to do. Everything around him seemed to scream at him for entering. It was like a warning, yet this wasn""t anything he didn""t already prepare for.",583994
32,"He was getting sick of Rio-the-red stealing his girl. ""Well, Blossom. We better go get dressed. Buttercup""s already angry she has to wear a skirt for an hour and a half."" Bubbles latched onto Bloss""s arm and peddled her out the door. ""Hey, can I watch?"" Brick heard himself ask. ""Nothing beats watching BC rant over a skirt."" Bloss shot him an odd look. Bubbles paled. ""Alright... What is it with boys and skirts? You""re brothers are coming too. Just don""t mess up the practice. Mademoiselle Avril is very strict about this."" Brick grinned. ""I""ll be a good boy."" He thought he heard Luna snicker kitty-cat-like behind him. Traitorous feline, he reiterated. ""All I""m saying is the bastard could have found another partner,"" Brick reiterated, flying into his own house. It felt foreign to him, since he was spending more time in Bloss""s room than anywhere else. ""But to hang the guy upside down over the Townsville beach..."" Boomer admonished. ""I expected that from Butch, but you?"" ""Hey,"" Butch defended. ""I""m nothing like Mr.-Taunt-and-Tease. I would have dropped him."" ""Couldn""t you have threatened him while systematically exposing his weaknesses like you always go?"" Boomer pointed out. ""And so what if he wanted to dance with Blossom for a song? She was going to turn him down right?"" Brick reddened, remembering what Mr. I-Wear-Tight-Leather-Pants-And-Hair-Gel had said. ""He had it coming, Boomer. He touched her ass. No one but me touches her ass."" That elicited a snicker from Butch. ""What about her other boyfriends? You know the ones that predate you."" ""Nice one, Butch. You learn that from BC. It""s so nice to see you using two-syllable words. And two in the same statement: that""s impressive bro. Looks like dating little miss power house is good for you."" Butch simmered quietly on the couch, knowing he couldn""t deny a thing. Brick took small pleasures in silencing his rowdier brother. It was a rare talent. Boomer squashed that pleasure with his next statement. ""Rio would have done something about it. I think he always does."" ""What?"" He vaguely heard his voice; it was dark and evil sounding, much like a villain in a dramatic cartoon. ""Well... Bubble-Bear, I mean, Bubbles said that Rio""s dealt with that guy before. But he always comes back. The farthest he""s gone is touching Blossom""s ass- and then Rio, he broke his arm..."" Hearing that his own attempt at saving his girlfriend virtue had been one-upped, and with the physical pain that Brick had been tempted to inflict himself, deflated his anger into apathy. ""B-but-Blossom seemed really happy that you would go through all that trouble of wrapping the guy in duct tape, raw Canadian bacon and fish heads for her... I think."" Brick wasn""t buying it, and away he flew to lick his wounds. Once in his own room, with Spitfire trailing, Brick flopped back on the bed and thought of Bloss. Even in the dark void that was his room, she appeared in his mind. ""Bloss..."" he murmured. He hadn""t even asked her out the second time yet; he was slipping. ""You called?"" her voice was a clear sound in the dark recesses of his room.",3439302
1351,"""The Sorcerer Knight,"" Magnus said, putting his dagger away. ""He used the Wind Spirits to attack her."" ""We""re lucky to have such a powerful Shaman with us,"" Greebus said, stoking his beard. ""This won""t be the last time he""ll come,"" Magnus said. ""We know his kind all too well, son,"" Gerrek said. ""He""s stronger than Wagnard, though,"" Ryna observed, ""If he can used the elements to his advantage."" ""I thought only Elves could do that?"" Maar said. ""What about you? You can cast spells and you""re just a little Grass Runner,"" Prince Orson pointed out. ""Yeah, but I can""t control Wind or Water or Fire or the Earth.

Transition ""D------ it!"" Ventus cried, as he got up from the floor. The power of the young half elven boy""s magic had thrown him from the pool where he conjured the wind spell. ""I had not known he was yet so strong! I should have known better. He is the son of a High Elf after all."" He turned swirlin his cape, and sat on the old throne of Marmo. Then, he threw back his hood, revealing long black hair, a young face, empty blue eyes, and long Elven ears. ""I shall not make the same mistake twice. But as long as the Princess is by his side, I cannot take hold of her mind and draw her here... I need rest."" He got up from his rumbling throne, and disappeared into the shadows. AN: Sorry it""s so short. If anyone has any ideas, or wants to see something done in fuutre chapters, then please tell me! Review! The city of Valis was a place of remembrance for Deedlit. She and the others of her party had arrived there nights ago, after the devastation of the great earthquake- another fulfillment of the old prophecy- and now, she feared for her son. And for the others. This enemy was unlike any they had ever fought before. Now, as the night air embraced her, Deedlit stood on the highest balcony. Remembering. ""Oh Parn,"" she said to the wind, ""What would you do? You would probably face this Sorcerer head on, like before. I wish you were here now."" ""I am here, Deed,' she heard his voice say. She turned around. Nothing there. But as she turned around an image seemed to be carried on the wind. ""Parn?"" Deedlit asked, daring not to hope. The specter flew down to the balcony and embraced her. ""I""ve always been with you, Deed,"" Parn""s soul said. ""In all these years, I have never left your side."" ""Oh Parn,"" she said, tears of newfound joy and old grief spilling over her cheeks, ""I""ve had to endure all these years, raising our son, protecting our village all alone."" ""I""ve been with you through ever hardship, Deed. I""ve seen Magnus grow into a strong young man, and I know he""s doing the right thing. I know this is hard for you, but I want you to always remember me, Deedlit. Even if I can""t be with you physically, I""m always with you in spirit. Will you wait for me Deed?

1632,"Alucard began screaming more at his brother, hoping to cut him with words and possibly get him to kill himself. ""I gave you everything you wanted and you stab me in the back! Is that how you repay kindness?"" As he shouted down his brother, he frantically tried to shove his damaged eye back into the right place but it repeatedly resisted his efforts, even falling out back onto his check again. At last the No-Life king just ripped out his damaged eye socket, leaving behind a bloody whole which was slow to heal from the blessed shot. ""Look here Radu"", he taunted. ""Don""t look away,"" he said with perverse playfulness. Radu winced and started to turn his gaze as he saw his brother shove a white gloved finger into his gouged eye socket. There was a squelching noise that made Radu want to wretch. Alucard giggled with schoolboy""s gross delight. ""Hear that?"" he asked as he felt around the inside of his eye socket. ""I think I can feel my own brain? Want to touch, brother?"" ""Just leave him alone!"" Seras cried out. Despite her state, if she was going to die she""d at least do it opposing Alucard. Alucard turned and jammed a finger at Seras until the bloody fingertip almost touched her. ""Shut your fucking mouth, you cunt!"" he snarled at Seras. ""Or else I""ll rape you to death right here!"" Alucard turned back to his brother and bit out a sarcastic comment. ""So you weren""t man enough to kill me yourself; I guess a coward can""t change his stripes."" Alucard tapped his heels together and rubbed his temple with his gun. ""But you know Radu; I fully understand how you were torn up with guilt over causing the death of Elizabeta."" The mention of Alucard""s dead wife caused Radu to wince. Whenever Radu became too independent for his brother""s taste, he""s get the Elizabeta speech again. Over half a millennium ago, Radu had fought for the Turks against his brother. As a ruse, he""s fired a messenger arrow into Vlad""s castle containing a message saying that Vlad the Impaler had fallen in battle. Elizabeta had been so crippled by grief at the news of her husband""s death that she threw herself out a window. The grief was so great that it drove his brother mad, or so he""d been told time and time again by his brother. ""You caused the death of Elizabeta and when she died . . . I really didn""t feel that bad."" ""What?"" said Radu? The banality of Alucard""s statement hit him like a punch in the gut. For centuries he""d laboured under the impression that his brother was torn apart by grief over the death of his loved one and that was why he turned away from God in the first place. ""You see Radu,"" said Alucard, ""I""m not the horrible person you think I am; I""ve been lying to you from day one."" Radu was hearing the words; he just couldn""t process what his brother was trying to say. ""Honestly, I loved Elizabeta with all my heart but she was a colossal bitch."" Alucard sounded so sincere and honest about what he was saying; he could turn it on and off like a faucet. In the past he""d learned how to cry on demand, knowing that his brother wouldn""t leave him if he pushed the right buttons.",1220273
1166,"""Well, one of my friends, Charles- he""s this guy who likes making movies- he needs a girl for one of the roles, so... like... yeah."" he finished lamely. ""Oh, here it is, damn thing- anyway, read this for me."" He held up a paper bearing a scene Charles had hastily scrawled out. ""What""s this?"" she flipped through it. ""Script,"" Cary grunted. ""Start from the highlighted lines on the first page. I""ll do Lex for you."" ""Alright... ahem... ""I don""t know, Lex, I just feel something... something different for Rob. It""s been out of control. Yesterday he smiled at me and I don""t know... my heart sped up, I broke out in a sweat, and I suddenly felt faint.'""

You say that about every guy you meet,'"" he read flatly. """"No, this is different, Lex. I feel like it""s meant to be. I really do. It""s like... fireworks.'"" She sat back, a critical expression on her face. ""Was that okay?"" ""Okay? Okay? That- that was-"" he couldn""t even find the words. ""Dude, Charles is gonna love you."" ""Charles, get your fat ass out here! I didn""t wake up at five on a Saturday for this crap!"" Cary""s shrill voice broke the early morning silence. ""I""m coming, I""m coming, just hold on-"" Charles"" reply crackled through the walkie-talkie. ""You said that ten minutes ago!"" Cary whined. ""Keep your shit together for a few minutes, I""m coming-"" ""You said that ten minutes ago, too! What""re ya doing, Charles, putting on your makeup? Let""s go, let""s go, we""re gonna miss the sunrise!"" ""Shithead, it takes a while to bike to Lookout Hill when you""ve got a camera, a tripod, and a mic on your back!"" ""Why me?"" Joe sighed to Alice as they watched Cary ape-out. His makeup box lay at his feet, along with a few reference books from the library. ""All I wanted to do was work for the movies and I get this."" He gestured to Cary. Alice giggled. ""So why is this hill called Lookout Hill?"" Alice asked Joe, perplexed. ""It""s what Cary yells when he sleds down here in the winter,"" Joe said, a faint smile on his face. Those were the good days. They""d have sledding races every day when it snowed- Joe always came in second, after Cary. Charles usually came in a close third, and Martin always fell off and hurt himself in the first round. ""Who""re you calling a shithead?"" Cary was yelling. ""Who""s a shithead?"" someone panted from behind them. Joe turned to see Elle clambering off her bike, gasping for breath. Her blonde hair was plastered to her forehead. ""Oh, no one,"" Cary said, putting his walkie-talkie behind his back. Ohmygodit""sreallyher- ""Cary, you shithead!"" Charles"" voice blared from the speaker. """"Scuse us,"" Cary smiled, wheeling around. ""Right, Elle, I""ve got to do your makeup, so if you could just-"" ""Huh?

169,"His hair looked so real that you could feel its golden radiance. ""Wait, what kind of clothes will he wear first?"" Tsujiai asked to no one in particular. ""I think clothes for summer,"" the prince answered. ""I think I have seen that clothes before..."" Luna mused. She shook her head. It can""t be.""Okay! Yuka-chan, pose now! That""s great!

I must find them..."" a figure whispered into the hot summer wind.-----------------------""Okay! That""s the last of the summer collection dresses,"" Maya said as she checked her list. ""How much time do we have before the Jusenkyo Potion loses its effect?"" she asked Sebastian. ""We still have about 30 minutes or so, Miss Maya,"" Sebastian responded politely.""Good. Sebastian, let Yuta wear our final weapon,"" Maya said. The audience looked at her curiously. ""You mean, ""THAT?!' Miss Maya, don""t you think it would cause us some troubles.. Erm... you know..."" Sebastian had an eyebrow raised. ""Of course. This chance is once-in-a-lifetime!"" Maya responded in a mischievous tone. ""Hey, Orihara, what""s with the secret weapon?"" Kaji asked. Maya ignored him. ""Okay, that was mean,"" he muttered.Sebastian sighed. He can""t stop Maya when she sets her mind into something. He turned to Yuta. ""Yuta- I mean, Yuka-chan, go now to the dressing room to get changed with your final costume. ""Yuta pouted. ""Aw! Final costume? I still want to continue! This is so fun!

""I hope it would be very cool!"" Rio said.""Hehehe! My brother looked soooo cute! Aw! Like sister, like brother!"" Mito giggled. ""Okay, Mito-san, you are weird,"" Tsujiai said.""Hey! Don""t call me Mito-san! It sounds like I""m a couple of years older!"" Mito said. ""You ARE a couple of years older,"" Tsujiai responded.Mito""s face turned red. ""What I mean is that it sounds like I""m an old hag or something. """"But it is the standard term for those elder than you,"" Tsujiai retorted.

3741,"""An attack on our lives?"" Lilly stepped beside her partner and looked at the officer. ""Are you kidding?"" ""No, he""s not,"" said Chris. ""Someone wanted us to have an accident. And they did quite a good job."" ""Oh Jesus."" Lilly went pale and leaned against Chris, who put an arm lightly around her shoulders. ""And what shall we do now?"" ""Who could have done it?"" Chris asked back. ""Not Gabriel, that""s for sure."" ""Does it necessarily have to have been the killer?"" Lilly asked. ""Maybe it was Jordan, just to take revenge because we arrested her husband."" Chris looked at her dubiously. ""You don""t really believe that, do you, Lilly?"" ""No,"" Lilly admitted. ""It wouldn""t make any sense, and besides it wouldn""t do anything good for Jordan or Gabriel."" ""Then we must have made a mistake somewhere, and the killer is still on the loose."" Chris bit his lower lip. ""Oh God, how I wish this whole case was already solved."" ""I""ll call Stillman and tell him we""re finished here,"" Lilly said. ""I suppose you""re taking care of that?"" she asked the officer. ""Sure,"" the officer confirmed. ""Maybe the mechanics will find some leads."" ""Maybe."" Lilly was not convinced. She called Stillman once again, who promised to send Nick Vera to pick them up. Nick arrived half an hour later, and the three of them went back to the police station. ""We have a guest, by the way,"" Nick informed them as they were climbing the stairs to the office. ""A guest?"" Lilly was confused. ""What do you mean?"" ""A guest,"" Nick repeated. ""You""ll meet him in a minute."" When the emerged from the staircase, Lilly peered into the room. ""Where is he?"" she asked. ""Straight ahead, talking to Will."" Nick pointed at their colleague Will Jeffried. The elderly, black detective was leaning against his desk, talking to a man who was sitting with his back turned on Lilly and Chris. Lilly narrowed her eyes. ""Isn""t that Gabriel?"" she said, confused. ""I thought he was still in custody."" Nick smiled enigmatically. ""Are you sure that this is Gabriel?"" he asked. ""Look closer."" Lilly was confused for a moment, but then something began to dawn on her. ""You mean this is..."" She trailed off and did as instructed: she looked closer. Right at this moment, the man turned his head, so that Lilly could see him from sideways on. He looked indeed very much like Gabriel. He had the same, handsome face and the same brown, graying hair. His brow was deeply lined, more than Gabriel""s, and his eyes had a different shape. But Lilly could now understand why everyone had mistaken Gabriel and Jamie for twins. With a few steps, she covered the distance between them and approached Will""s desk. ""James Jarvis?"" Jamie turned around. ""Yes."" Even his voice sounded like Gabriel""s. Lilly had to pull herself together not to simply gape at him. Instead, she stretched out her hand. ""I""m Detective Lilly Rush. I""m running the investigation. Thank you for coming."" Jamie got up and shook her hand. ""You arrested my brother,"" he said. It was not a question. ""I fear that""s true,"" Lilly said. ""There has been some evidence pointing to him.",240213
3672,"The wound was no longer covered up aside from the bandages that resided on her lower abdomen. Certainly that would raise some questions, but not as many as if she were wearing a red shirt. Now all she wore was her black sports bra and the shorts, Benny made her remove the boots considering it would bode well with native style. ""So Camp Murder is directly down the path from Bad Town, if you keep walking you""ll make it there eventually."" Benny informed, feeling rather confident with himself for a moment, he added, ""And also... If you need anything, I am willing to help."" Although Lunetta didn""t exactly want his help, she took this moment to ask for items of importance. ""I am gonna need a gun. Not now, but... I am a pirate so... Also perhaps some feminine products would do."" Benny smiled at her despite the dull voice in which she said everything and nodded his head. ""Anything you want I""ll get it for you. I""m here if you need me."" It made her want to vomit, he was becoming so lovey dovey simply because he had feelings for her she didn""t reciprocate. She looked back out the window, leaning her cheek into it this time. When Benny finally pulled up along a fenced in development, she knew it was Bad Town without a doubt. Benny turned off the car and waited silently. ""Go in there and convince them somehow into getting to Camp Murder. Take this."" Brent sat up slightly to uncomfortably reach into his left pocket, removing a small track phone. He handed it to her and she shoved it into one of her pockets. ""Give us a call if anything comes up. When you arrive in Camp Murder with the goods, we""ll be waiting, so be smart about it."" ""How do I get the Americans"" attention?"" ""Act."" Was all that Benny said and she gulped, feeling the nervous jitters one would feel on the first day. She exited the vehicle, as soon as the door was close the car zoomed of and Lunetta was left to fend for herself. When Lunetta first stepped into Bad Town, she was met with inhuman conditions, rats scurried around beneath the elevated shanties, ungodly scents surrounded the area, the dirt creased in between her tiny toes, it felt like bugs beneath her feet. She was met with the sight of deranged natives, some leaning leisurely against dirty cardboard buildings and others sitting on the ground in the muck of the unsanitary earth. Voices sounded from everywhere, shouting this way and that coming from shanties as she passed. Stepping over the prickly splinters of wood that bridged over the trenches of water that flowed from the river alongside the Town. She received stares as she curiously stepped further into hell, passing a market and a whore house, where rotten fish carcasses and disease ridden women were sold alike. She felt that unexplained feeling that someone gets when being watched and stopped in her tracks looking around with narrowed eyes, when she saw only the usual pairs on her, she continued walking, much more cautiously this time. At the end of Bad Town was a bar, she assumed that this was where she would find the Americans and quickly made her ways towards it.",6234395
1817,"He sighed mournfully and laid his head back down on the ground, with a tear rolling out of his eye and closed his eyes to go back to sleep. Eddie woke up also, but little did Crash know, is that Eddie""s dreaming of his mom, as well. He looked at Crash and saw him, getting all teary-eyed, like he finished crying, probably because of the bad dream he had. He sighed softly and really felt sorry for him, because he could""ve helped Crash as well to get rid of the wolf that killed their mom and he got a little misty-eyed and by the he closed his eyes, he opened one eye, as a tear started to come out of his face.

He held his arms tighter, to keep himself from getting cold and everything. He feels a small pat on his shoulder and he turned around it was Eddie. He sighed and asked, ""What do you want?"" He sat down next to Crash and said, ""I just want to talk to you."" ""Dude, I really don""t feel like talking."" ""You have to tell me sometime, otherwise it""ll keep bottling up inside you and you""ll explode at any given moment."" ""There""s nothing to tell, Eddie!"" Eddie grew concerned about his brother, thinking that there""s nothing wrong with him, but he knows there""s something wrong with him and he wants to find out what it is and how it""s affecting him. He looked at him and said, ""You""re in denial."" Crash stopped himself, looked very agitated at Eddie and then, turned around slowly and asked, ""What did you say?"" ""Dude, you""re in denial. You just don""t want to admith that there""s a problem. I know it had something to do with our mom, right?"" Crash sighed exasperatedly and replied, ""Okay, you caught me. I can""t stop thinking about her. You got anything else for me?"" ""I just want to ask you....why couldn""t you tell me or any one of us about your depression?"" ""I thought you and Ellie knew about my problem."" ""Yeah, when you told us about what you were thinking about, but not why you hide it from us."" Crash started to look really angry and told him, ""You know what?! You want to know why I hid it from you guys?! Okay, I""ll tell you. You have NO idea what it""s like to just feel guilty about your mother dying before her eyes and see her laying down in a pool full of blood on her body and seeing it at a young age.

I blamed myself for not helping her and getting rid of that stupid wolf that killed her. How do you think this makes me feel?! So, don""t you come around her asking me how I feel, because I know you were there, but it""s too painful for me, because you don""t understand anything! YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW I FEEL, EDDIE!!!!""",1276465
2690,"She did have a good point. If it weren""t for Ralph, they would have been unplugged, but they should count themselves lucky to have people playing them in the first place. ""I guess so. But hey, there""s plenty of old games that are still pretty popular."" he remarked. A loud rumbling noise emerged as the response to Felix""s remark, its volume steadily increasing as it seemed to climb up the building itself. As the rumbling only got louder and louder, silverware and glasses shook, and the patrons began to run about in panic. Suddenly, people were leaving, and some even started running when they caught a glimpse of something from the one of the high rise window. Hungry beyond words and now quite annoyed as well, Sergeant Calhoun stood up and walked towards the window, with Felix just right behind her. ""Alright, alright, just what""s causing all this fuss?"" she asked loudly, only for Flo to appear right next to her, a worried expression on her face as she realized exactly what was going on. ""Oh dear. I knew there was a reason there were so many people in this game!"" ""What you mean?"" Felix asked, the rumbling only getting even louder as something huge shuddered the entire building with its bulk. ""I just opened my restaurant here. It seemed like a nice place to start a new business. But all this time I thought it was just an empty game!"" Flo practically yelled, as the rumbling threatened to drown out all other noise. ""Empty game? No game is empty! Where the heck are we, Felix?"" Sergeant Calhoun shouted, her tone of voice clearly showing her frustration. She got her answer though, when a massive hand, covered in brown fur, crashed through the wall of the building, reaching for whatever was within its grasp. It managed to latch onto the largest person within reach, which just so happened to be Sergeant Calhoun. As she struggled against its raw strength, and as Felix and Flo watched in terror, the creature truly revealed itself, climbing up into their view. What now held his dynamite gal hostage was the biggest gorilla Felix had ever seen. All Felix had to do was take on look at the bristling muscle hidden under his fur to know that Sergeant Calhoun wasn""t escaping any time soon. Still, that didn""t stop her from trying. ""Let go of me, you evolutionary has-been! Let go of me so I can fill that face of yours with all-you-can eat laser buffet!"" she threatened, though the gigantic monster simply ignored her, and in his grip she was unable to reach the spare gun that she had kept hidden in her dress this whole time. It was about this time that she was start to regret going with Felix to an unknown game without her armor and her rifle. Smiling through his massive canines as he looked at his new prize, George took one last look at Felix and Flo, before he continued his climb, with Sergeant Calhoun trapped in its unbreakable grip. ""No, no, no! That""s my date, you big monkey!"" Felix yelled in frustration, before turning back to Flo, who was still reeling in shock. ""You moved your restaurant into Rampage? What were you thinking?!""",967934

He has moths flying around him and has henchmen by his side who are dressed like him. The costumes criminal then says, ""Huh huh, I am ""The Killer Moth"" and I shall rob the proceeds of this party!

1849,"But contrary to popular belief, I was doing it in this very moment. I had decided to take the initiative to shut up Haruhi in the one way I knew I could. By kissing her. As unreasonable as it sounds; it was the only reasonable soultion. I can only imagine the expression on Haruhi""s face. Surprise was my main guess. But when I didn""t feel her struggling against me; or punching me in the stomach, I got the hint she was very okay with it. I let my eyes open, to only see that Haruhi had hers closed; as if she was completely absorbing this moment. I snapped mine shut; afraid of the consequences of catching me spying on her reaction to my sudden kiss. Nevertheless, it became awkward when she wrapped arms around the back of my neck. That; I did not expect. We stood in this embrace for a minute or so; the sunset behind us. I didn""t care who might see this. I doubted they would ruin the moment anyway. Nothing could ruin something like this. When we came apart, Suzumiya-san looked at me in awe and wonder. I still don""t know if she experienced that very same dream that I had; but I could care less at this point. I was looking into Haruhi""s eyes; immersing myself in the amber, liquid orbs. ""You""re not a time traveler, alien or esper, Kyon."" Haruhi said to me in an annoyed tone; breaking my train of thought and the silence between us after I had just kissed her. ""Are you so sure? For all you know; I could be."" I joked; now content with the demeanor the Suzumiya-san was showing. I had missed this part of her old self she had displayed when I first met her. ""I""m not sure at all. But I guess you""ll do for now. You""re lucky you""re a good kisser; or I would have shot you down like all the other humans before you."" She told me, before firmly taking me by the hand. I smiled. I assumed that this was Haruhi""s way of telling me she was glad I actually returned what she felt for me. I wasn""t surprised. Being used to her constant orders; I knew what she meant when she said certain things. I wasn""t completely clueless about the way she showed her emotions. We walked along now; holding hands as the sun was in the process of setting in the sky. It was a little awkward; but Suzumiya-san took no notice of it; acting as if we""d been dating for months already. I didn""t mind all this one bit. When we reached her house, she still felt as if there was more for her to say. ""Let""s get a few things straight. You better listen to everything I say now. And no more perverted thoughts about Mikuru-chan! And you""re responsible for calling me Brigade Chief all the time now. You address me as that no matter what!"" she said to me; serious and overbearing at the same time. I didn""t so much mind. I only chuckled, which caused Haruhi to just look at me with a little shock. ""Don""t worry about it. If that""s how you want it; then that""s how it""ll be."" Haruhi looked surprised that I took in her commands so easily. They weren""t so hard to listen to. It really wasn""t much of a change of what I normally did anyway. It""s just that Haruhi was going to be my significant other now.",967934

My first Ice Age fanfic in 3 years. R&R, please! This is where it gets heartfelt for everyone. Chapter 10: Talking About Mom As sunset come forth, the gang continued walking towards the horizon and heading south. Crash still has his mother on his mind and Eddie looked at him with a smile and a wink. Crash winked back and smiled at him too. Ellie asked, ""So, thinkin"" of your mom?"" ""Yep. As usual."" said Crash. ""You never asked us about your mom, anyway. What was she like?"" asked Sid. ""What wasn""t she like? She""s special to me and Eddie. We would always spend time with each other, keeps us all together and most times, would have enough strength to take care of us and Ellie."" Crash explains. ""Yeah, she""s keeps us all together and completely gives us comfort. In fact, they taught me how to be a possum."" said Ellie. ""You didn""t tell us that your mother raised you as a---"" Manny paused when he saw Ellie""s eyes turning stern and gives out a ""stop while you""re at it"" look.

""That""s incredible. She""s like everything to you guys, right?"" asked Diego. ""Exactly."" ""So, what happened to her?"" asked Manny. ""Well, one day, she went out to get some food for us until some wolves caught her holding some berries and then, they leaped up and attacked her out of nowhere and chased her around, wanting a piece of it. Then, she dropped the berries and kept on running. Then, they spotted us and we had to keep Ellie away from them as soon as possible. So, she had to find a place to hide from them and she hid in a log, hoping that they won""t find her. But, when they left, she took off running again and the wolves caught her running, but we distracted three wolves and we had to fool them by catching us to avoid catching our mom and then, we ran off until we reached the highes part of the cliff, and we turned around to confuse them and they fell down on the cliff. We completely fooled them and we thought we should check on mom and see if she""s okay, but by the time we got to her, it was too late. All that""s left of her is blood, a dead body and a tragic loss."" said Crash. ""We thought she was playing dead, but with the blood out of her body, it was obvious that it was real and that she really is dead."" Ellie said. Eddie sighed while being a bit misty-eyed and said, ""I guess she died for us, you know? Things always happen for a reason, but we were in tears after this happened. It was like, ""please tell me it didn""t even happen"", but it did happen.""",1276465
1175,"Stella added to her husband. ""Well, I hope you like meatloaf, Marty and Anne..."" ""Anne? Who""s-?"" ""Well, that""s your sister, isn""t it? Anne Klein?"" Stella raised her eyebrows. Marty looked at Elle. Elle looked at Marty. She shrugged. ""Yeah. That""s us,"" he said, putting an arm around her. ""Calvin and Anne Klein."" ""Oh, ho, ho! Look at it roll!"" Sam hooted triumphantly, wheeling in the TV he had been messing with. ""Now we can watch Jackie Gleason while we eat."" The rest of the family fixed their attention on the TV, but Lorraine kept her eyes on Marty. ""Our first television set,"" she said shyly. ""Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?"" ""Well, yeah, you know, we have... two of them."" ""Wow!"" said one of the little boys. ""You must be rich!"" ""Oh, honey, he""s teasing you, nobody has two television sets,"" Stella said good-naturedly. Silence descended on the table once more as everyone returned their attention to the TV. In flickering black-and-white, a man appeared through a doorway, covered head to toe in aluminum foil and cardboard boxes. A metal pot sat on his head in a comical way. Elle nearly choked on her potatoes. ""Hey. Hey, I""ve seen this one, this is a classic!"" she blurted. ""This is where Ralph dresses up as a man from space!"" ""What do you mean you""ve seen this?"" the boy said. ""It""s brand-new."" ""Yeah, well, er, I saw it on a... rerun,"" Elle said, remembering where she was. The boy stared at her. ""What""s a rerun?"" Elle looked away. ""You""ll find out..."" she mumbled, feeling her face heating up. Stella propped her head in her hand thoughtfully. ""You know, you look so familiar. Do I know your mother?"" Marty took a fearful glance at the teenaged Lorraine beside him. ""Yeah, I think maybe you do."" ""Well, I want to give your mother a call. I don""t want her to worry about you guys."" ""You can""t,"" Marty blurted. ""That is, uh, nobody""s- nobody""s home."" ""Oh."" ""Yet,"" he added, in case she got the wrong idea. ""Oh,"" she said again. ""Uh, listen, to you know where Riverside Drive is?"" Elle jumped in, rescuing him. ""That""s on the other side of town, a block past Maple,"" Sam said, not looking away from the TV. ""East end of town."" ""A block past Maple, that""s John F. Kennedy Drive,"" Elle worked out the directions out loud. Sam tore his eyes away from the TV to look at her. ""Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?"" ""Um, mother?"" Lorraine said, her voice high-pitched and innocent-sounding. ""With their parents out of town, don""t you think they oughta spend the night? After all, Dad almost killed Marty with the car."" ""That""s true, guys,"" Stella said. ""I think you should spend the night, I think you""re our responsibility."" ""Gee, thanks, Mrs. Baines..."" ""I mean, I don""t know..."" ""And Marty can sleep in my room."" Marty suddenly leapt up as though he""d been electrocuted. He grabbed Elle""s wrist and pulled her up with him. ""Thanks everyone, it was wonderful, you were all great. Uh, we""ll see you all later."" Marty opened the door. ""Much later,"" he murmured before fleeing into the night with Elle in tow.

140,"Nodding almost mechanically, I turned my eyes back around to face his...only to see that the concern he""d been wearing once before was slowly morphing into something that looked a lot more like fear. Why? I wasn""t entirely sure at that moment, but either way, he quickly hid it when he noticed my questioning look. ""I""m fine, Scott, really. Honestly, it""s more you that I""m worried about being here. What""s wrong? You look like you""ve seen a ghost,"" I wondered aloud, as I gave him one more piercing look for his own unnerving one from earlier. Though, I knew I""d never be able to drag whatever had caused it out of him without at least putting in some effort for it, but then again, a part of me really didn""t think that I wanted to know right now. ""Oh um...it""s my father... he kind of got hurt. I just came to make sure..."" ""It""s alright, Scott. You don""t really have to explain it to me. You should probably go on in, and make sure that everything""s alright though. If that was him on that stretcher, then to be perfectly honest, he looks like hell. I""d be a little worried too,"" I mumbled while giving him a gentle gaze in return. ""Yeah, he""s not good, at least that""s for sure. Either way, how about you tell me why you""re actually here? Are you okay? I heard from Isaac about what happened. You kind of had us all worried about you, you know. I really felt bad about the whole thing. I mean, it kind of was my fault, and I should have known that Isaac might say something to rile you up. I""ll admit, he""s never been that particularly good in the comforting department,"" Scott answered kindly, as he reached out to place his hand on top of my shoulder in a caring little gesture, one of which, I didn""t particularly shy away from for once. After the encounter with the Oni, I was still pretty shaken, and right now...well, I could use a little comfort, even if it was from him. Letting out a defeated sigh, as the events from the entire night finally seemed to wash over me, I couldn""t even stop the watery little chuckle from making its way past my lips. As I reached up to wipe away the stray tear that had stupidly escaped, I already found Scott reaching out to do so. Giving him a thankful smile for the kind gesture, I replied, ""Physically, I""m fine Scott. I""m just...dealing with some stuff right now that I don""t feel like particularly discussing. You understand, right?"" Nodding, Scott quickly retorted, ""Well, just so you know, all of us are here for you when you do decide to. Trust me, none of us are going anywhere no matter what you""ve got to say. You honestly can""t surprise us at this point either, but just so that we are clear about it, Stile""s isn""t you""re only friend. I am too. All of us are. Even if you don""t think so, or even want it, we""ll always be here for you..."" ""I don""t need your pity Scott..."" ""It""s not pity. It never was.

Shota was crying in front of Chidori""s while Alexander Howell stood in front of Aki""s. I started to walk to the coffin of Chidori when Toya stopped me. ""You forgot this."" He handed me the bond, the one with the celestial symbol in it. I stood, frozen in the spot. Memories of Chidori flashed back at me. The day I met her, the day we saved Shota, the days we spent together...the day...she...""I""ve always wanted to...' ""Yuuhi, don""t stop yourself from crying. It doesn""t mean you are weak. Emotions are not weaknesses but strengths,"" neesan whispered to me. She then proceeded to get Shota. I griped the bond tightly. Maybe she was right. Maybe I need to let loose these emotions that are bottled inside of me. Yes, Yuuhi, you are right. Mustering all the courage I have, I walked to Chidori""s coffin. There she lay. She was so beautiful. Her hair was kept down with a tiara on it. She was dressed in an off-shoulder silky gown, like the one she told me that she would wear in our ""wedding"". There is still that smile that she had on the day she died. My Chidori...the woman I""ve decided to marry, is now here, sleeping peacefully. Tears started falling from my eyes. I didn""t bother to wipe them. STUPID ME! Why am I so stupid! Why have I only realized that I love her moments before she died! Why haven""t I told her those words!!!

962,"I suppose both may have a part of the truth. Tonight, however, I will tell what I believe happened. Nearly twenty four years ago, a young man named Darwin Coupette sailed from his lavish estate in France to the island of Japan. He had a great talent for painting, and he yearned for new subjects. A friends of his was planning on going to the foreign land on business, so Darwinasked to join him. When he arrived he was captivated by the exotic beauty of the people...the women most of all. His friend, a man called Mister Sharp, purposed that the young man go to one of the geisha houses, take one of their women, and use her as subject and... companion. The poor boy, he did as Sharp suggested, but when he went to the house of ill repute, he found something quite extraordinary. One of the girls had come to them that very morning, and was still- according to the man running the brothel- a virgin. Darwin took one look at the girl and loved her. He took girl, Kiku- whom he called Chrysanthemum- with him to a house that overlooked the port of Nagasaki, and there she became his lover and his model. Allow me to pause, and tell you that Darwin, though a man of great passion when he chose, was also very fickle. After four months, he grew bored with Japan, and young Kiku. In fact, upon receiving a letter from Odelle, his fiance in France, he set sail immediately to marry her, leaving Kiku the house, the servants, and all his debts. One year after Darwin left, the manager of the brother came to Kiku""s door, demanding she return. For her former lover""s many debts were piling ever still. Kiku refused, and said that before he had left, she and Darwin had wed. She told him that now she was a Catholic, and if she were to return to the brothel, her soul would go to hell. Her old employer was furious, and demanded proof. So he contacted Sharp, and the two planned to prove Kiku a liar by having Sharp speak with her. To their dismay, she only swore more to being Darwin""s Christian wife, and showed them the child that she had born- Darwin""s child- as final proof. Sharp immediately contacted Darwin. He denied everything, and said the girl must have been so innocent that she believed being with one man would be considered a marriage. The young man and his wife both knew that if any one else were to discover this mistake, their reputations would be ruined. So in order to uncover Kiku""sdeciet, they both sailed back to Japan. When Kiku saw Darwin coming up the path to the house with his flaxen haired wife, she knew she was trapped. And so she put her child on the bed, then she took her own life. When Darwin, his wife, and Sharp entered, Darwin cried out in horror, and fell to the ground, clutching the dead woman. He might have been fickle, but a part of him had loved her once. Not long after, the baby started to cry. Darwin released Kiku""s cold body, and picked up the child. It was a girl, with eyes as green as his own, but with wisps of black hair on her head.",512464
1744,"She reminded me of myself, running through the sandy beaches of home with France trying to chase me down for my lessons. He never caught me. Didn""t really try to, either. He was always so kind and playful... ""Away for a while,"" I choked out, ""We... we""re going to Paris, Eri."" Eritrea""s eyes brightened, ""That pretty city you always talk about, SeySey?"" ""Y... yeah,"" I nodded and stood back up, looking around as the soldiers continued looking for the others countries that had hidden with us. They wouldn""t find them if they hadn""t yet; we hadn""t survived this long for nothing. Eritrea grabbed my hand and squeezed it with all the might in her tiny body. I wanted to scream. A military truck came to a stop in front of us, close enough to make all eight of us flinch. But the Empire soldiers stood strong and, one by one, thrust forward and jerked us into the truck. When we were all in two of them pulled themselves, holding assault rifles in their hands. They sat on either end of the truck""s opening and I held Eritrea tighter to me. Another threw the gate of the back of the truck closed and I heard the distinct click of a lock. Eritrea whimpered and held onto me with her little fists, her body shivering. It wasn""t even cold out. In the distance, coming out of one of the buildings, I saw him again. Dressed in his military finest as before - almost as fancy as during the War of Austrian Succession - France scanned the grounds as if looking for something. All blues, reds, frills and lace. Fashionable, as he always has been. I remember when he showed up on my island like that, a bright smile on his face and the wind flowing through his golden hair. A choked sob ripped from my throat at the memory. A soldier hit me with the butt of his gun. The truck kicked to life again and started away from what was once our sanctuary, and in the last moments the two of us locked eyes. He mouthed something to me and my face paled. ""J""ai finalement vous avez trouvé, mon chéri Sesel,"" He smiled that sweet, kind smile from my childhood. Almost, ""Tu es à moi à nouveau, une partie de moi.""

3063,"Garnet backed away from the mysterious figure as it started to jump up and down excitedly, pleadingly trying to get Garnet to order it around again. The figure had only stood at about three or four feet in height, smaller then Garnet, but its strong presence told Garnet not to underestimate whoever it was that was inside the black hooded cloak. Garnet had taken another step back when she realized that the behavior pattern was similar to someone else she had met. Actually, a combination of people... ""Are you Kuja""s son?"" The figure stopped its excited ranting and immediately calmed down, similar to how a kid would act if he had been caught in the act of something devious. ""So you actually know who I am then. Surprising, but not unexpected from someone like you. So, what, surprised to see me here?"" Garnet glared at the figure, her anger flowing back inside of her. ""Why are you here? I thought you had died that day, upon the branches of the Iifa tree. Akio."" Garnet spat out the name like it had left a bad taste in her mouth. Although Garnet never angered easily, this mysterious figure had been able to call up Garnets anger almost instantly. The figure, Akio, just laughed. Akio pulled his hood back, releasing his long, silver hair to tumble down around his face. His hair style was similar to Kuja""s layered silver hair, except that Akio had long, layered bangs framing his face. The front half of his hair reached down past his shoulders, but the back was shortly layered, and didn""t reach much past his neck. Akio took a deep breath, spinning around in front of one of the many glass-stained, but sunny windows. Before getting dizzy he stopped, facing Garnet. She continued to glare at him. ""He may look innocent,"" Garnet had thought, ""But I cannot underestimate him."" Akio smiled at her. The two seemed to have forgotten that anyone else but them existed. ""Do you want me to tell you why I""m here, Garnet?"" Garnet just stared, keeping silent. Akio took that as sign to continue his story. He smiled. ""My death at the Iifa tree was overly exaggerated, my Queen. I have to say, my acting skills are top notch when I put my mind to it. Heh, Kuja didn""t even know that his own son was still alive after I was done with my performance. Of course, that was part of the plan. Did you know that if Father dies before I do, then I inherent his powers in addition to my own? When Father had found out about that little ""detail"", can you believe he tried to kill me? Such a mean family I have..."" Garnet scowled. ""I was there when we saw you die - I may have been young, but I still remember it. I don""t know how many times you tried to kill Kuja before you launched an all-out attack at him. Are you still after his power, now that he""s alive again?"" For the first time since Akio had appeared, it seemed as if Garnet had stuck a nerve in him. ""I had inherited his powers when he died! I was the most powerful person on this planet! I could control what was left of the silver dragon race, in addition to my own powers, I was unstoppable!",583994

The mouth leads to a giant set of intestines, which dumps him to the sixth dimension, and stumbles upon a door, where a boxer that looks like Rolf punches him out. As he""s coming to, a group of mysterious robed men come out of a door marked ""The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo"" and start to drag him off. Eddy asks ""Where are you taking me? Where""s Ed? Where""s Double D? I demand an answer..."" but then he noticed in shock that Ed and Double D are the hooded men, poking him in the butt with their pitchforks and then Eddy asks ""Is your boss the leader of this dimension?"" and the ""Mystic Knight"" that resembles Double D says ""nooo! that""d be the midget king...AHAHAHAHA!"" and he pokes Eddy with his pitchfork again. The ""Mystic Knight"" that looks like Ed just sings ""Going down, down, down, how far can you go? You might fall into the Forbidden Zone ..."" They lead him down a corridor and into a cavern filled with white light. ""Abandon Hope, All Ye Who Enter Here"" descends from the ceiling written in flaming letters. As they pass through the door, they discover a horned figure dressed in a white zoot suit with tails, as he turns around, the figure looks exactly like Lee Kanker but with a evil grin and red horns on her head, he suddenly conducts an orchestra to the tune of ""Minnie the Moocher"" and starts to sing... ""Well, son, let me tell you, I""m so pleased to meet you The boys and I been expectin"" to greet you As guest of honor in the house of the dead Just relax, lay yourself down, Say goodbye to your head! Hi de hi de hi (Hi de hi de hi) Ho de ho de ho (Ho de ho de ho) Waddi-waddi way dee (Waddi-waddi way dee) Hi de hi de ho... (Hi de hi de ho...) Eddy is then placed near a tree stump and Lee chops his head off and his head is used for a football in a ""Devilbats"" football game... MEANWHILE...BACK IN THE REAL WORLD... Double D is still studying law and Ed is still watching horror movies with the gold statures of Nazz, the Kanker sisters, Plank, and Sarah...Ed then giggles and goes up to Double D and says ""HEY DOUBLE D! THEY""RE MEXICAN WRESTLERS! hahaha!"" Double D then sees the statues of Sarah, Lee, Marie, and May wearing Ed""s filthy underwear on their heads. Double D is shocked at this and says ""Ed, that is very immature and disgusting...then again they kinda deserve that...not the gold part but the underwear part... JUST LET ME STUDY OK! WE GOT TO FREE EDDY AND THE OTHERS SO IT IS IMPORTANT IF I STUDY INSTEAD OF HELPING YOU GOOF OFF WITH THE KANKER STATUES! (sees Ed cry) Sorry Ed if I got angry it""s just that we need to help our friends out at this time...so please let me be and continue having fun ok?"" Ed then smiles and rubs his butt and armpits on the Kanker statues faces just to be funny. Midnight struck and in a pentagram, Eddy appears in a cage of flames and Double D says ""Eddy! you""re ok, how""s HFIL?""",910821
456,"Then skin grew outwards, and before long this corpse was no longer a corpse, but a living woman. Jamila finally turned her eyes away from The Book of the Dead as she too saw a body beginning to form, and smiled as her mother came to be awake. Anck-Su-Namun""s eyes fluttered open, as her senses came back to her. The last thing she could remember is running in the pyramid at Ahm Shere. Then regret filled her being as she remembered why she had been running. She had been afraid. She was afraid she would die, but more so, she was afraid she would never see her love again. She would have helped him, honestly, but at that moment she had frozen with fear...and the O""Connells had been right there! If she had tried to save him, they both would have died. She had thought that if maybe she escaped that she could bring him back, but how wrong she had been. Anck-Su-Namun remembered her death clearly. One minute she felt as free as could be, and felt like she was going to make it out, and then the next... well the next she was falling into a pit of scarabs as they ate her alive. Oh the pain had been so terrible, and then the afterlife had been worse. Separated away from her love for all eternity, and forced to live with the regret, and guilt. However, how had she come to be here? How had she awakened in the world of the living? Turning her head as she gazed around the room, her eyes landed on one person in particular, and she felt the regret overcome her. Tears seeped into the corners of her eyes as she gazed at him. Could it really be? Imhotep smiled as she looked at him. Slowly, as if the words hurt her, his love replied in, ""Imhotep?"" After giving her a nod, she then turned her gaze upon Jamila. Anck-Su-Namun eyes leaked with tears of joy and recognition, as she asked in wonder, ""Jamila?"" Jamila""s own eyes misted over as she looked down upon her reincarnated mother. Without a second to wait, she ordered the guards to help Anck-Su-Namun sit up. Then, reaching into her bag, she produced two long black robes, and threw them to the two lovers. As they threw on their garbs, Jamila went to completing her plan. Once clothed, Anck-Su-Namun took to her feet, and made her way over to Imhotep. Reaching her head up to touch his cheek, she whispered, ""I""m sorry. I was afraid. I-"" ""Shh all is forgiven my love. It has been to long for trivial matters such as that,"" Imhotep reassured her, as he took Anck-Su-Namun into his arms. Holding her close he placed sweet butterfly kisses onto her skin, before kissing her passionately on the lips. Yes, it had been to long. While the two lovers were busy getting reacquainted, Jamila was finishing with the incantation for the guards and priests to become full bodied. True, the splitting over her soul was becoming agonizingly unbearable, and she probably should have done it, but they need warriors. They needed protection if all was going to go right. Finally, after every last servant was returned to their own flesh and blood, Jamila collapsed next to the alter.",806976
1461,"""Will you be breast feeding him or..."" Andy didn""t give him time to finish as she said, ""Breast feeding. I heard a urban legend that it makes them smarter."" ""And makes the mother skinner,"" John said remembering the rest of the legend. Andy looked up at him and hit him. Suddenly she felt really tired as she yawned. ""I thought you might be tired dear. Maybe it""s best if you all leave and give her some rest. Trust me she needs it. Anna help change her bed please so that she could sleep on something more comfortable,"" the doctor said as they all walked out of the room. John""s POV. John felt like he was on cloud 9 right now as he walked through the halls. He felt so happy and Magneto noticed it, ""He was truly an amazing child John. You should be very proud; you""re the one that made him."" John smiled and looked up at him and said, ""I am."" ""Come boy, I think both you and I should have a smoke,"" Magneto said pulling out a pack of cigarettes. ""Haven""t had one of these in a while, but I think this is a big enough event to,"" Magneto said as they walked out to the garden that was a place for the nurses to sit out and eat or just take a smoking break. Mystique soon joined them after dropping by the cafeteria to get a cup of coffee. Andy""s POV. Back in the hospital room though Andy had just fallen asleep when her mind let all her barriers fall. She could feel someone reaching out to her and she reached back the best she could. ""Andy are you there,"" Xavier asked. ""Yes,"" She said. ""What has happened,"" Xavier asked since he had felt a new presence in the world. ""I gave birth to a healthy baby boy,"" she could feel a happy aura in her mind and Xavier say, ""I""m so happy for you. I will tell Bobby. What is his name?"" ""Jonathan Bobby Allerdyce,"" she said and then quickly asked something, ""Xavier is he...is he a mutant."" Xavier was quiet for a few moments before he answered. ""Yes he is, but what he is I do not know,"" Xavier said. ""Thank you,"" Andy said as she slipped from the connection and fell into a deep sleep. Xavier""s POV. Xavier opened his eyes to his office and found Bobby there. ""So is she okay,"" Bobby asked since Xavier had called him in when he had felt something happening to Andy earlier. ""Yes she and the baby are fine,"" Bobby""s face lightened and said, ""What do you mean her and the baby."" ""She has given birth to a healthy baby boy,"" Bobby smiled as his eyes looked down. He couldn""t believe she did it. He never thought she would make it all the way. ""And Bobby,"" Bobby looked up at him with a smile still on his face. ""She named him Jonathan Bobby Allerdyce,"" Xavier said with a happy glint in his eyes. Bobby laughed at the irony in the name. John would probably be thinking the same thing right now. His name put together with is ex-friend""s was kind of ironic. ""Is she going to be alright,"" Bobby asked again. ""Yes she""s good and healthy herself,"" Xavier said and then added, ""You should call your older cousin and let her know."" Bobby nodded and got up and headed on out. Xavier looked down at his papers and couldn""t help but smile.",806976
301,"What would happen if she just became an essentially powerless; but still eccentric, bizarre and slightly rational high school girl? I will assure you all; I don""t think that question is going to be answered anytime soon. And may Haruhi strike me down with all her power if I""m wrong. Actually; scratch that last part. I think I""d rather remain intact for now. I do still have a semblance of an extra-ordinary high school life left to live. Well, well, well....what is this we have here? Unfortunately; I cannot disclose anymore. You will all find out soon enough! ~~~~~~The Incapability Of Haruhi Suzumiya~~~~~ By Hejin57 (Now Playing. :)) Stay tuned. (Ultra-super Disclaimer: I own nothing related to The Melancholy Of Haruhi Suzumiya at all. That is property of Nagaru Tanigawa.) Wow, I really didn""t expect people to actually like this story! So, I have decided to continue it! Much bigger and better than before! Haruhi Suzumiya has always been the most eccentric girl I""ve known, but there are times where I can truly be amazed at some of the things she does. Walking into someone""s house without asking is one thing, but searching through all their personal items and belongings without asking is another completely. And that was the case with Haruhi. She just began going through nearby drawers, closets, you name it. And all without even asking my permission! Being the one who was carrying all her bags and such, my face was just looking more and more annoyed by the second. ""Why are you tearing through all my things?"" I said, dropping her bags on the wooden floor as I attempted to control the tone of my voice. Haruhi looked back at me almost innocently, giving the kind of face that made it look like I was the one being an asshole. And hey, maybe I was. But she was just going through the contents of my house, and frankly, it was beginning to piss me off. ""I""m just searching for anything strange or unusual! It""s part of my duty as SOS Brigade Chief!"" she told me flatly, and all I could give was a sigh in response. Haruhi just merely went back to searching through one of the closets in the hallway, pushing aside various clothes and junk like she was mining for gold. I really doubt she""ll find anything strange in there.... But of course, Haruhi has to contradict me somehow. I could see her eyes suddenly light up as she reached a hand up to the top shelf of the closet, and she had obviously found something. She began pulling it out, and when I saw it, my face turned to a look of utter horror. Or more like, utter embarrassment. When Haruhi finally pulled her hand out from the mustiness of the hallway closet, I could see she was holding what looked like a magazine. A very private magazine. One that was never supposed to be found!!!!! My face was already flushing red, and Haruhi was looking at me like I had three heads. She awkwardly flipped through the magazine for a few minutes, prolonging my torture. Finally, she put my private magazine back up on its musty shelf in the hallway closet, closing the door without even saying a single word.",967934
174,"Hisako seemed to giggle to herself again, puzzling Matsushita and making Fujimaki frown in annoyance. She shook her head back and forth before answering the judo expert. ""I don""t know what you""ve been told, but expensive gifts are definitely not the way to go. She""d probably just get insulted if you got her something like that..."" Hisako rubbed her chin as she began to think to herself. As the others waited for her answer, Fujimaki just seemed to be trying to ignore her. Every time the fight-holic looked at Hisako, he always felt his heart skip a beat. He hated the feeling, and he could never let anyone know about that. It would ruin his reputation forever. ""Rock, dust, light, star?"" TK asked, but as usual, his answer made no sense to Hisako. Her mind was already made up however. She gave Matsushita a very sly smile before leaning on the table right next to Fujimaki, aggravating him even more. ""I think I""ll let you figure it out. If you really are the right guy for my best friend, then you can succeed without my help. I don""t know how""s he going to help you though."" Hisako said, referring to TK. The dancer almost seemed insulted at first, but he shook it off and responded with one of his usual catch-phrases. ""Kiss you!"" Matushita looked down at his desk, realizing the challenge before him. And TK""s phrases weren""t really making any sense to him now, so how would this guy""s advice help him before break was done? The judo expert sighed, his voice sounding suddenly dry. ""I hope you""ve got something good planned, TK..."" TK snapped his fingers and spun up from his chair. ""It""s my turn! C""mon let""s dance!"" T.K Break had always been one of Iwasawa""s favorite times of the day. It was a little strange. She enjoyed creating music more than listening to it, but she still couldn""t help but cherish anytime she could get the chance to just listen to music that someone else was playing. And the break between classes, where most people would eat lunch and hang our with their friends, was the time when she sat in the club room and listened to her music. And so naturally, Iwasawa did not hear the sound of someone knocking on the clubroom door. TK continued to knock on the door repeatedly as Matsushita waited anxiously. Nevertheless, the judo expert felt extremely nervous right now, so he hoped TK would be able to do most of the work for him. At the same time, he cursed himself for being so weak. ""Knocking on heaven""s door!"" TK shouted from the outside of the clubroom door in his loudest voice. Iwasawa was too absorbed with her music to hear him, and he could only groan to himself as he discovered the door was locked. ""Maybe this isn""t the best time."" Matsushita commented. He was beginning to think this was all turning into a really bad idea. TK looked at him with a serious face. It was a face that pretty much told the judo expert... ""There""s no giving up now."" And so, Matsushita said nothing, and TK continued to knock on the door like a maniac.",967934
2635,"Dracula tried to bend D out of shape, make his son as monstrous as himself. But Mina had emotionally neutered D. She""d beaten any ability to have a meaningful emotional relationship out of her son. D wanted to get back at the witch for all the ways that she""d screwed him up. He gritted his fangs as Mina""s face turned blue and her struggled weakened. Oh yes, that""s what he wanted to see. He wanted to strangle the bitch until her eyeballs popped out and rolled around on the stupid linoleum floor of their old home. D grinned as his mother""s eye sockets burst out of their skulls burst out of their skulls but still it wasn""t enough. Then he woke up. D blinked and his mother was gone. In his mother""s place was that stupid girl that had been stalking him. Apparently in his drug induced weariness, he""s begun to strangle her and he just thought it was his mother. Speaking of strangling, he should probably let go of the girl before she suffocated. D""s spiderlike hands let go of Asenath""s throat and he watched her gasp for air. Thankfully, he hadn""t been squeezing as hard as he had during the dream, otherwise the poor girl would be six feet under by now. Leaving Asenath to gather her breath, D stood up and sat down on the rim of the centuries old toilet bowl. Vampires didn""t need toilets but many of their servants did. It was a shame that the air fresheners had broken down, this room really reeked. D spoke to the girl, ""I""m sorry, but I""m told that when I strangle people I""m sexy."" Asenath didn""t have enough breath to say so, but she agreed. She""d been strangled before by kinky lovers but she""d never been so turned on by it until D had tried it. D signed, he wasn""t as young as he used to be. Ever since Luna""s death, he just didn""t have as much energy as he used to and his temper was much shorter. He felt old. Asenath looked at D and trembled. She""d had this thing all planned out, the angle of her approach, what she""s say to D and how she would say it. But now, she was nothing but a babbling idiot before his awesome beauty. Edward Cullen, eat your fucking heart out. Trembling, she noticed that D still had some vomit on the side of his mouth. If he asked her to, she""d gladly lick it off. Instead though, she timidly handed D a tissue from her pocket. D took the tissue without saying thank you and wiped himself off. Asenath couldn""t look away as D discarded the used tissue on the floor. ""What were you doing here?"" D made Asenath feel like a preteen girl in a sex-ed class being asked an embarrassing question. ""I love you,"" she squeaked. D brushed the long hair out of his eyes, ""Go home."" His words cut her, ""I don""t have a home."" D saw the hurt on her face; he just didn""t give a damn. ""There are over a thousand rooms in this castle. Choose one and stay there if you like, just keep out of my way."" Horror filled Asenath""s heart, this wasn""t right; this wasn""t how it was supposed to be. D couldn""t be this cold. Nothing that beautiful could have a hideous heart lurking within. She tugged at his hand like a small child, ""Please....you don""t even know my name.",1220273
3639,"People always want what others covet,"" she said. ""What about you? I wanted to deny her logic, but I couldn""t. None of the girls who asked me out knew who I was -- they were just interested in me because of my looks or my class ranking. ""I haven""t accepted anyone, either,"" I admitted. ""See?"" she said, rising to her feet. ""Anyway, don""t you have practice today?"" she asked. I glanced at my watched. ""I have about fifteen minutes,"" I lied. In reality, I already should be there, but the Kendo captain would give me a little slack. ""How did you know?"" ""Well, I was hoping to meet with you today for the student council work, but that won""t work."" ""I can help tomorrow,"" I said hurriedly. I didn""t want Miyazawa carrying all the work. There was a lot of it, especially since the Student Council assigned extra to our class, since I had been the Class Representative, and Miyazawa had entered as the Number 2 student. ""But..."" she began to protest. ""Really! Tomorrow, after class, we""ll do it together!"" I said, grabbing my bag and disappearing before she could argue. Tomorrow couldn""t come soon enough, for me. That night I dreamt again. Miyazawa and I had a mountain of paper work to be done. For some reason, the brilliant minds of the Student Council had given us twenty copies of ten-page forms to be filled out -- by hand. It would have made more sense to fill in most of the similarities before photocopying, but the Student Council Secretary had never been the sensible sort. So we had two hundred pages of forms to fill in, many of them with differences so minute that only the trained eye would catch it. It was tedious work, but I was glad to be sharing it with Miyazawa, even though I knew she would gladly do it on her own. She was considerate like that. I appreciated it. Her hand writing was as neat as ever as she began to fill in her half, and I made a point to be just as neat. There was something about her that drove me. I noticed how she flipped through the papers quickly, setting them down neatly so they could dry. She was still using the messy pen, rather than the ballpoint that would have been more practical. I liked that about her. It was elegant. Finally we were done with the monotonous task. It had only taken an hour. Miyazawa rose to her feet and organized the stack, the papers rustling as she did so. ""Well, then. Twenty copies of each of these,"" she stated. She sounded satisfied. I heaved a sigh of relief. ""I""m exhausted,"" I admitted, wanting to talk to her, but unable to think of a subject. She gave my a sympathetic smile. ""It must be terrible for you, Arima-kun."" It made me smile at her in return. Only Miyazawa would have empathy for someone like me, when she had such burdens of her own. ""What about you, Miyazawa-san?"" I asked, wanting to know about her. I really didn""t know that much about her. ""Aren""t you busy with council work and studies?"" ""Well, sort of,"" she admitted. ""But I don""t think about it much anymore. Besides, I""ve always been doing this stuff, so I""m used to it."" I knew the feeling.",1112924
2322,"The thought made her shudder though she wasn""t sure why. Bruce took her chin and made her look at him. He asked, ""Are you afraid of me?"" Selina knew he was looking for her to say no, but she hated to be predicable. So she used her legs to grip him tightly and pulled his face down to hers. She used her deepest Catwoman purr to answer him, ""Everyone""s afraid of Batman."" She didn""t give him time to react, sealing his lips with hers. He stiffened for a moment before bringing his hands to her ass, lifting her from her perch and bringing her closer to him. How many nights had he fantasized about this? He couldn""t remember, he didn""t want to remember the number of times he""d stopped himself from thinking about the thief he wanted. He""d used Selina to block his thoughts of Catwoman, and after discovering her identity he could no longer employ such a strategy. So that every time he""d met with Catwoman and every time he""d seen Selina across the room as some annoying beauty whispered nonsense in his ear - there had been no way to sate his lust. He""d used her to forget so many times. What was one more time? He flexed his fingers and grunted at the feel of her soft curves. She shuddered again and gasped into his ear, ""Oh Batman."" Bruce picked her up fully and slammed an unmasked Catwoman into the nearest cave wall, consuming her mouth with a ferocity he would""ve controlled if he""d been with anyone else. Selina arched her back, from pleasure and to escape the rough, cold cave wall, but Bruce forced her back, pinning her to the wall as his lips moved to her neck. He was the only man she would""ve let get away with such a controlling action, but in retaliation, she extended her Catwoman claws and tore them down his back. The Kevlar protected him from feeling any more then their sharp impact though this suit was tattered beyond repair now, if there had been any question before. His hips were pressed so tightly against her he no longer needed his arms to hold her up, so he grabbed her hands and placed them above her head. He used one of his hands to keep them there and used his teeth to rid his other hand of his glove. He then used his ungloved hand to cup her breast as his mouth found hers once again. His hand wandered... She enjoyed his ministrations for a while, but as soon as she found a weakness she used it to throw them to the ground, landing with her on top, straddling his waist. Her claws were still extended so she used them to grip the bat emblem on his chest, furrowing and retracting much like a cat would. She fell forward and whispered in his ear, still using her sultry Catwoman voice, ""Tell me, how does one get you out of this suit?"" She pulled back; dragging her claws down, mirroring the marks she""d left on his back. He moved to sit up, but she threw herself at him using her weight to knock him back, attaching her mouth to his. It was her turn now. She distracted him as she disarmed him, flinging his belt aside. God only knows what she might accidentally trigger pressing the wrong button on that thing.",1497577

Today is only the second day of school and yet so many things have happened. Looking back at the memories of the previous night, he shrugged. He was currently making his way to school, perfectly dressed and a good 45 minutes earlier than yesterday. You could say he almost didn""t sleep just to make sure that a certain lady wouldn""t fidget with his alarm clock again and cause him to be late for school. The calm morning air of a Tuesday greeted his exhausted body, the silence that was broken momentarily by passing bikes played in his ears. The road was deserted except for commuters like him who would wake up early to enjoy this majestic part of the day. ""Oi!"" His brown orbs narrowed as a figure appeared down the end of the road where it curves towards the train station. Pushing his glasses up the bridge of his nose, he raised an eyebrow. ""Kanzaki? What in the world are you doing in here?"" The lady in question grinned, ""Good morning, Yo-shi-to,"" she said sweetly, emphasizing on his given name. Kikuchi stopped in front of her, running a hand down his brown locks. With raised eyebrows, he asked, ""Care to explain why you are here?"" Kanzaki pretended to be innocent. She looked down on her outfit, which consists of her black school uniform and matching black shoes. Bringing her gaze back on Kikuchi, she spoke slowly, ""Judging by my outfit, I think I am going to school."" He readjusted his glasses, ""Har,har,har, as if that answered my question."" Kanzaki dropped the innocent look, ""Actually, Onizuka called me an hour ago. He said something about meeting here-"" She was cut of by the roaring sound of a motorcycle closing in. Just then, a perfectly polished motorcycle jumped from a bush. The screeching tires signaled its stop in front of the two teenagers. Sitting casually on the said vehicle was none other than the great teacher Onizuka. ""Good Morning everyone!"" he greeted loudly, a toothy grin plastered on his face.",560480
181,"May the spirits have mercy on my soul for such blasphemy."" A huge weight lifted from Yuuki""s shoulders as she finished with her words. There was a lightness in her heart now. Her body began to relax. Slowly, she found herself able to look at the boy in front of her. There was a quality in Switch""s blank stare that no longer bothered her. Instead, it made her smile just a little bit. ""So...what do you think of this?"" she asked nervously. ""I imagine this is very sudden, and I should probably apologize for my attack on your personal space yesterday..."" Switch typed slowly, his gaze fixed only on Yuuki. [I""m not sure what I think. At least, not yet.] ""I will not be surprised to have my confession rejected by you. I""m far from your scientific ideals, after all..."" Yuuki commented sadly. Switch continued typing however, his synthesized tone still methodical despite how quiet it was. [The truth is that these four days have been a test on myself. The countdown has come early. In less than three minutes, my computer will shut down completely. Only then will I know what I truly think, and if the time I spent with you has affected me at all.] ""I do not completely understand..."" [Soon you will. You should be flattered, Yuuki-san. I""ve gone to a lot of trouble just for you. Maybe the fact that we""re both so dedicated to our ideals is what sparked these thoughts in me. Or maybe it was my own mistake in thinking that you didn""t look as pretty without make-up. I""m not exactly sure.] Switch slipped off one his laptop suspenders. [But I will be soon enough.] His voice was beginning to fade away now. [I will warn you now, Yuuki-san. You may end up hurt and dissatisfied. I am truly sorry if that occurs.] Yuuki nodded in understanding. Then the otaku slipped off the other suspender. He was holding his laptop in his two hands now. There was a light beeping sound, before the familiar ghostly wail emerged. ""Fool! You are forever a victim of the Midnight Curse!"" Midnight...the exact time when Switch had stopped speaking. The moment he closed the window. The cryptic silence felt like it would last for an eternity as Switch slowly put his laptop down on the concrete surface beside him. His blank stare remained as he clapped his hands together. Yuuki could only watch in astonishment when reached for his glasses. He stopped an inch away from them though, taking a moment to gaze into the occult girl""s eyes once again. He could see it now. There was beauty to her, both inside and out. He had known that for a long time. It was only now that Switch could truly admit it to himself. Then the otaku removed his glasses, and the world changed completely. He could feel something different as he looked at Yuuki without a frame around his vision. A slight change began to happen at the corner of Switch""s mouth. Over the next few seconds, a smile emerged. Switch slowly took Yuuki""s hand. Her cheeks just became redder as she found herself lost in his eyes. Then, for the first time in years, Usui Kazuyoshi opened the window. ""I could care less about the occult.""",967934
955,"The figure stopped its excited ranting and immediately calmed down, similar to how a kid would act if he had been caught in the act of something devious. ""So you actually know who I am then. Surprising, but not unexpected from someone like you. So, what, surprised to see me here?"" Garnet glared at the figure, her anger flowing back inside of her. ""Why are you here? I thought you had died that day, upon the branches of the Iifa tree. Akio."" Garnet spat out the name like it had left a bad taste in her mouth. Although Garnet never angered easily, this mysterious figure had been able to call up Garnets anger almost instantly. The figure, Akio, just laughed. Akio pulled his hood back, releasing his long, silver hair to tumble down around his face. His hair style was similar to Kuja""s layered silver hair, except that Akio had long, layered bangs framing his face. The front half of his hair reached down past his shoulders, but the back was shortly layered, and didn""t reach much past his neck. Akio took a deep breath, spinning around in front of one of the many glass-stained, but sunny windows. Before getting dizzy he stopped, facing Garnet. She continued to glare at him. ""He may look innocent,"" Garnet had thought, ""But I cannot underestimate him."" Akio smiled at her. The two seemed to have forgotten that anyone else but them existed. ""Do you want me to tell you why I""m here, Garnet?"" Garnet just stared, keeping silent. Akio took that as sign to continue his story. He smiled. ""My death at the Iifa tree was overly exaggerated, my Queen. I have to say, my acting skills are top notch when I put my mind to it. Heh, Kuja didn""t even know that his own son was still alive after I was done with my performance. Of course, that was part of the plan. Did you know that if Father dies before I do, then I inherent his powers in addition to my own? When Father had found out about that little ""detail"", can you believe he tried to kill me? Such a mean family I have..."" Garnet scowled. ""I was there when we saw you die - I may have been young, but I still remember it. I don""t know how many times you tried to kill Kuja before you launched an all-out attack at him. Are you still after his power, now that he""s alive again?"" For the first time since Akio had appeared, it seemed as if Garnet had stuck a nerve in him. ""I had inherited his powers when he died! I was the most powerful person on this planet! I could control what was left of the silver dragon race, in addition to my own powers, I was unstoppable! I could finish my Father""s work, the work that he took so much pride in before he met... his love."" Garnet decided to play on Akio""s anger. ""But Kuja is alive now, and has been for quite some time, right? In the end, it had been Zidane""s and Kuja""s unspoken love for each other that managed to bring Kuja to see his terrible past - and want to be redeemed for it. I""m betting that when Kuja came back from the dead, the powers that you had received upon his death went back to their rightful owner. Not only that, but he took some of your powers as well. Am I right?""",583994

1494,"""It""s not a date. It""s just a favor I""m doing for him."" Sergeant Calhoun stated, clearly annoyed at the implication of them as some sort of couple. That was the last thing she needed getting out, especially to any of her soldiers in Hero""s Duty. Vanellope giggled, clearly ignoring the sergeant""s attitude towards the whole thing. ""Well, alright. But even if it""s just a ""favor"", you still need to look nice for it. And it""s not like I""m going to be wearing any of those dresses any time soon. They might as well get used by someone!"" Descending from her armored shoulder, Vanellope took the Sergeant""s hand, and with surprising strength, began to drag her away. Though normally this kind of thing would get on Calhoun""s nerves, there was something about the little candy girl that she just couldn""t stay mad at Any Cy-Bug that was lucky enough to assimilate her would have been a major threat to the Sergeant for sure. ""You know, you two are so cute together! When are you getting married? Can I be the maid of honor?"" Vanellope exclaimed, leaving Sergeant Calhoun practically speechless at the sound of the concept of marriage. ""W-What kind of nonsense are you saying?"" I""m not getting ma-"" ""Oh, quiet! The sooner we get some of those dresses on you, the better!"" Vanellope commanded. Clearly, there was no arguing with this girl. At least her tenacity could be admired. It reminded Sergeant Calhoun of herself once upon a time. Felix walked with surprising confidence as closing time arrived for the arcade. While game characters of all shapes and sizes made their way back into Game Central Station, having just made it through another day of gameplay and high scores, Felix felt like his day had only just begin. Clad in a nice blue suit that the Nicelanders had given him specifically for tonight, he was dashing enough at least that even the passing eyes of gaming""s more popular girls couldn""t help but give him a second glance. But he could care less about attention from the likes of Samus Aran or Sarah Kerrigan. He cared only for the love of his one and only dynamite gal, who he finally spotted sitting alone just next to the entrance to Hero""s Duty. And what he saw of her was almost too much for him to fathom. Somehow, Sergeant Calhoun had managed to make herself that much more radiant. The dress she wore was silky, black and red, and had a design on it that resembled licorice. But despite its clearly sweet origins, it was still so oddly fitting on her. But what had Felix so enamored wasn""t the fact that she was wearing the dress, and how good she looked in it. No, it was the fact that for once, she wasn""t wearing her armor. He found himself entranced in something he did not think was possible: the fact that she did indeed have an actual body under that armor, one that he particularly found beautiful beyond words. And for a woman involved in so much violence, she was quite slender and almost fragile even. Now was the time that he realized his words had been such an understatement before. High definition graphics could truly do wonders beyond his imagination.",967934
3477,"Yves said something to the other person in the room, then she turned her attention to me once again. ""Listen, Jimmy, I really gotta stop now. There""s a lot of stuff we still need to discuss here."" ""Alright, Yves. See you some time soon. Take care."" ""You too, Jimmy. Bye."" She hung up even before I could say ""Bye"" as well. I placed the receiver back on the table and flopped on the bed. Staring at the ceiling, I tried to figure out what this all had meant. But my thoughts were going on a rollercoaster ride around my head, and only gradually did they settle down. I wanted to cry. This was not what I had planned. I had planned to go for a drink with her, talk about this and that, and then somehow slip in the question that was burning in my mind. I had certainly not planned to talk to her on the phone for a few minutes, only to find out that she didn""t have any time for me. I tried not to think that, no matter how much work Yves had to do, she would have found the time to meet me if she had really cared.

705,"But as I felt the tap and looked down, all air wooshed from me. A long, thin blade rested gently on my hip. ""I had a list, once,"" she said, as calm and collected like one would discuss the weather, ""Every single person on that list is dead. I even fed one of them his own children."" I was sweating, eyes wide. In a single flick of the wrist, she could disembowel me, ""I did it all for myself and my family. And I would do it a thousand times over. Would you?"" I blinked, breath shallow and mouth dry. Her blade dug in tighter and stung at my hip, ""I-I""ve never killed nobody."" ""Would you?"" Arya leaned forward slightly. There was something dangerous in her eyes, a wild glint of an animal kept caged too long, ""Would you hunt me down, if I took someone you loved? Would you do anything to protect them, avenge them?"" ""If you...?"" My eyes widened. I""d never considered killing anyone. But this girl, younger than I, had the exact eyes I""d imagined a killer would have. When I didn""t answer, she tapped my hip with the sword. I swallowed thickly, knowing from her probing eyes that lying wasn""t an option, ""I would want... To protect them. I-I would stop you from killing th-"" ""That""s not what I asked,"" Arya said, ""If I killed, say, Tyrion Lannister."" Her eyes flashed and I froze. She smiled a bit, a weird quirk of the lips that creased her grim face, ""Would you kill me back?"" ""Yes,"" she leaned back a bit, and the blade was gone. But then her gaze shot back to me when I added, ""Unless you had a really, really good reason."" ""Oh? And what kind of reason would that be?"" ""Are you going to hurt my father, Arya?"" It was easier to be bold when a blade wasn""t pressed against oneself. ""There""s no one on my list at the moment, so no,"" she looked back out the window for a moment, eyes searching. Arya shot me a look when I didn""t say anything. I gulped, ""I-If he""d done something. L-like, killed your family or-or something like that, then... wouldn""t it be justice?"" ""So you""d want to protect those you love, but if they were rotten, twisted things on the inside, you wouldn""t be against disposing of them?"" ""That""s a... callous way of putting it."" She shrugged, ""It""s a better worldview than one where those in power rule like tyrants because the people who cared more about themselves and said tyrants did nothing."" ""But your brother""s the one in power,"" I flinched when her eyes snapped to mine, ""Even though he doesn""t want to be."" ""So you""d support Jon? Not everyone""s happy he has the throne. And besides, him not wanting it is the best reason for him to have it."" I shot up, immediately gripping at the roof of the carriage so I didn""t tumble on my still tender leg, ""Of course I would!"" She regarded me for a long time in silence. I wanted to bolt from the carriage, but it was still in motion. That would not be a good plan if I wanted to stay in trampled. Then Arya looked away, face impassive yet oddly satisfied. This time, it was I who purposefully sat as far from her in the carriage as possible. I slipstitched the hole in my dress closed before anyone else went into the cabin.",748687
3696,"It""s basically a bunch of stories about the past talking about God and the people he worked through to get other people out of a bunch of big messes. There""s one about a place called Egypt...beautiful place...very hot, lots of monumental sculptures and pyramids dedicated to the afterlife. Well, there""s a bunch of people there that believe in God and they won""t worship the ruler of Egypt cause he isn""t God. Those people were in slavery and subjected to really Hellish lives...they were literally worked to death. So along comes a guy named Moses. He was in a prophecy kind of like Alice and I are. The Pharoah-the leader-finds out about it and orders all the baby boys killed. To save his life, his mama puts him in a basket and sends it down the river. Of all people, the royal family find him and adopt him. They don""t know who he really is. So Moses grows up and he knows something""s wrong. God eventually tracks him down and tells him who he really is. He tells him about leading his people out of Egypt. When Pharoah refuses to let them go, a bunch of really serious curses come down on the Egyptians until he agrees to do it. Then, there""s this big chase scene where he changes his mind and decides he wants all his slaves back. They escape into the desert and that""s when things get heavy again."" Aurora paused for a moment, thinking. ""At first, they""re hopeful. Okay, they got out of Egypt and they""re literally no longer chained. But then things get a little hard. It""s hot...it""s dry...they""re hungry, thirsty, tired. They start complaining. They start deciding maybe they""re not so much better off and they want to go back because they knew what would happen to them in Egypt. Moses gets a little irate at them. God Himself gets irritated. He""s thinking ""I got them out of Egypt, don""t they trust me by now?' So they end up wandering Egypt for forty years as a consequence of their lack of faith."" The breeze had stopped and the night was still. ""Things are scary right now,"" she commented, ""and I""m doing my best to believe we""ll come out of the desert eventually...but it""s a little hard sometimes. Especially with everything that happened yesterday and today. The Oraculum says I""ll rule this place, but I have my doubts when Iracebeth keeps ordering people killed."" He didn""t know what to say to her. She was obviously very stressed, but he wasn""t well versed in comforting people. ""And Tarrant and Mally...I don""t want them to die. They""re only doing what the prophecy says."" That statement was made with the utmost conviction. He had never felt such a sharp pang of guilt as he did in that moment. In a very indirect way, she was asking him to help them. ""I know..."" he said miserably. The pressure built for several more seconds. Finally, she blurted it out: ""Can""t you do something? Like smuggle them out of here? You have enough pull over these guys!"" ""I do,"" he answered, ""but someone will eventually see it and tell Iracebeth. Then we""re all in trouble.""

504,"Ivy""s wicked grin could almost be heard over the phone, ""Haven""t you heard? A little birdie dropped dead."" Selina relaxed, relived by the news for a moment. She pushed thoughts of Bruce""s pain from her mind, reestablishing her Catwoman persona, and she replied in her best teasing, silky tone, ""We""ve ruled out natural causes I suspect?"" Ivy laughed. ""Come to the Iceberg and you can hear the tale for yourself. One of Joker""s henchmen is on his fifth retelling. Get here soon enough and you""ll be able to catch the sixth show."" Selina was already fetching her costume, ""Joker""s not there to brag about it himself?"" ""He""s in critical condition at the hospital."" She said it in a tone that betrayed her feelings, or lack thereof, for the sadistic clown. Selina bent over to retrieve the clawed gloves she""d dropped and shifted the phone as she began dressing, ""Well, keep the nobody talking. This is a story I want to hear and I""ll be there shortly."" ""Please, first the Joker kills Robin and then Batman practically breaks down and nearly beats the Joker to death, I""ll keep him telling the story until his voice is hoarse."" Selina hung up, and threw the phone on the bed. Her costume was only half on, but she inhaled deeply, gathering the strength to listen to the story of Bruce""s latest worst night ever. She had to listen to the story, because now that she knew that the story involved the Joker and ended with a dead Robin, her imagination would never stop. And then after the appropriate amount of drinks and time, she""d seek out Bruce. Whether he liked it or not. Bruce stared at the computer screen, trying desperately not to blink. Because every time he closed his eyes, he saw Jason. Jason broken and bleeding as the Joker beat him with a bloodied crow bar, Jason crying out to him for help, Jason""s dead eyes. Bruce did not look forward to his next confrontation with Scarecrow; Crane had a whole new bag of nightmares to unleash upon him. He didn""t let himself pause on those thoughts and went back to researching fixes for the Justice League satellite, a task he""d been putting off for too long. Every time the computer took a moment to fetch information, Bruce cursed internally because it gave him a moment to think and remember. Jason Todd was dead. He""d type until his fingers were bloody, he""d stay awake until his body collapsed from exhaustion, and he""d never stop. That was his edge, his preservation and determination are what make him the Goddamn Batman, and he would not let the Joker and a dead teenager derail his mission. Jason Todd was dead, and it was Bruce Wayne, Batman""s fault. He continued to work, desperately trying to force his mind to only see how to repair a satellite with Kryptonian technology. Feelings were a weakness. He was no longer a child crying over his dead parents, he would not break because of this. He should""ve saved Jason, he could""ve saved him, just like he could and should have saved his parents. No, he""d only been a child when his parents died, he couldn""t have been expected to stop that.",1497577

""I""d better take Lady Percival""s, she wouldn""t want a man to enter her chambers,"" Lara said, taking the hollyhock. ""Off you go,"" Gaius smiled at them. I already had one foot out the door when Gaius added, ""I need hardly tell you that the practise of any form of enchantments will get you killed.""

They""d both successfully delivered their medicines without getting lost, and now, at Lara""s request, it was time to explore Camelot.

""It""s not that bright."" ""Bit like you, then,"" the blond said. His knights laughed jeeringly at the poor servant. ""I""ll just put it on the other side then..."" Merlin watched as the servant lifted a heavy, wooden circle with a red dot painted on it, surrounded by an intricate design. ""This""ll teach him,"" Merlin heard the boy mutter to one of his knights. As the servant was moving the target, the blond threw an knife at him, hitting the dot square in the center. The servant lowered the target, looking both surprised and offended. ""Hey, hang on!"" ""Don""t stop!"" the blond ordered. ""Here?"" the servant asked, clearly wanting to put the circle down. ""I told you to keep moving!"" the boy aimed another dagger, and the servant barely had time to cover his face with the target; another bullseye. ""Come on!"" the blond egged him on. ""Run!"" The servant complied, struggling with the weight of the target. ""We want some moving target practice!"" the blond managed to throw a few more daggers before the servant collapsed under the wood""s weight. The target rolled a few meters before falling at Merlin""s feet; as the servant made to pick it up, Merlin put his foot on it. ""Hey,"" he said. ""Come on, that""s enough."" ""Merlin, what are you doing?"" Lara asked as the boy""s face changed from amusement to apprehension. Merlin ignored her. ""What?"" the blond said. ""You""ve had your fun, my friend,"" Merlin smiled at him. ""Do I know you?"" the boy asked, clanking over tohim. Merlin stuck out his hand. ""I""m Merlin-"" ""So I don""t know you."" ""No."" ""And yet you called me ""friend.'"" ""That was my mistake. I""ve never had a friend who could be such an arse,"" Merlin replied with a tight smile. ""Careful, there are ladies within hearing,"" he responded, mirroring my expression. ""I don""t believe I""ve caught your name?"" he added to Lara, flashing a smile at her. His tone had changed from mocking to charming, just like that. Merlin narrowed his eyes at him. Who was this guy? ""Larabelle, but people call me Lara,"" she said, shaking his hand. ""Pleasure. I""m Arthur, by the way."" He turned back to Merlin, but Merlin had already started walking away. ""So tell me, Merlin, do you know how to walk on your knees?"" Merlin sighed. ""No, I don""t.""

3746,"Through the glass wall, she saw Chris, who was talking to Nick for a few minutes, then the stocky detective waved and left as well. Lilly watched her partner as he cuddled in the enormous armchair that Will Jeffries had tracked down somewhere in the building. Lilly closed her eyes, but although she was so tired, it took her a while to fall asleep. She doubted that anyone ventured another attack on their lives, not today and not tomorrow. This whole brake business seemed very much like a spur-of-the-moment decision to Lilly. Someone in the community did not consent to Gabriel Jarvis""s arrest. But who...? Lilly could literally feel herself dozing off, and when she finally fell asleep, she dreamed of dark places and buried skeletons. Chapter Ten - Jamie ""Wake up, Lilly."" Lilly yawned, groaned, and finally managed to open one eye. Chris was standing beside the couch, waving a bag of fresh rolls. Now Lilly also noticed the smell of coffee. She sat up and rubbed her eyes. ""Care for breakfast?"" Chris did not wait for an answer. He put the bag on Stillman""s desk, left the office and returned with a pot of coffee. Before Lilly had even put her shoes on, Chris had completely prepared the breakfast table. ""That""s service,"" Lilly remarked with a smile. ""You""d better hurry. We should get finished before Vera turns up,"" Chris warned. Lilly laughed, but she admitted that Chris was right. Nick and Will entered the office when Lilly and Chris had just finished their second cup of coffee. The rolls were gone, and Chris had gotten rid of the evidence - crumbs, spilled honey and the bag. ""Slept well?"" Nick asked as soon as he opened the door. ""Like a baby,"" Chris replied. ""And you, Lilly?"" ""Me, too."" Lilly took a sip from her coffee to hide her grin. ""When is Jamie due to arrive?"" Nick asked Chris. ""Nine thirty,"" Chris replied. ""I suppose you don""t wanna miss his story?"" ""Not for anything in the world,"" Nick enthused. ""I""ll call Dorian,"" said Lilly. ""I suppose he wants to be there as well."" ""Very well,"" said Nick and looked longingly at the coffee pot. ""You two don""t happen to have a cup of coffee to spare for two hard-working colleagues, do you?"" ""Let""s see what we can do."" ""Your full name is James Alexander Jarvis?"" ""Yes."" ""You are here to deliver an official statement. Please note that this conversation is going to be taped."" ""I do not object."" ""Okay, then let""s begin."" Lilly sat down and changed her tone of voice from very official to official. ""You know that a skeleton was found in the area where your family is still living. Our investigation has shown that the body is that of a young woman called Natalya Atrochenko, who used to work as a housemaid for your parents. She disappeared in 1967 and was believed to have stolen your car and some money. But in fact, she was murdered and buried. ""Furthermore, we have learned that your brother, Gabriel Jarvis, had an affair with the victim. She got pregnant, and your brother, who had never planned this, tried to find a solution. ""We believe that the solution he found was murder. You were his confidant.",240213
2416,"he asked my solicitously, the way he would have ask a man in his dotage. ""R-really?"" I stammered. I didn""t like all this attention, though it was what I was used to. I could feel Miyazawa""s eyes on me from across the room, and I wished I could explain to her that I wasn""t asking for this. I doubted that she would approve- Miyazawa didn""t strike me as the type who would approve of this sort of foolishness. ""Like a perfect match for Miyazawa-san!"" the first one declared. I could hear the hearts in his voice, and I prayed to whatever deity was listening that Miyazawa hadn""t heard him. From the tense set of her shoulders, I was willing to wager the family business she had. ""You got that right!"" the second agreed loudly, and I wished for some pit to open under my feet and swallow me. No such luck. They continued, unaware of my fervent desire for some natural disaster to strike. ""I like Miyazawa-san!"" ""Me, too!"" Then I felt it. The darkness stirred within me, and I gripped the desk tightly. Dammit, she wasn""t theirs. They had no right to embarrass her that way. I could see the heavy blush on her cheeks, and I knew that she could hear everything. Those damn idiots. One of them hit me upside the head playfully, and it distracted me from my brief surge of anger. ""Hey, all the girls are going for you!"" ""Damn you!"" the other teased. ""Haven""t any confessed yet?"" the first wanted to know, and again that blush covered my cheeks. I remained quiet, just smiling at them. It really was none of their business who had confessed their heart to me, and I wasn""t about to betray those girls. It took a lot of courage to share your feelings, and I respected them. ""Argh, dammit!"" the first one swore at me. ""I really should be upset at you!"" I blinked in surprise as the second one chimed in, speaking to the first. ""But it""s like you can""t dislike Arima."" ""You""re not as bad as another boy, you""re really incredible!"" The first one assured me. My smile became more genuine, but the tension in Miyazawa""s slender body bothered me. I would have been embarrassed to hear myself spoken of in such a fashion, and I couldn""t blame her. Still, when I saw her after school that day and tried to apologize, she shrugged it off. ""Miyazawa-san?"" I called, trying to get her attention. She was seated at her desk, organizing her notes as was her habit immediately after class. I straddled the seat in front of her desk, so I could face her. ""I just wanted to apologize for this morning..."" I began. She was silent for a minute before she capped the messy pen she preferred and looked up at me. ""It""s okay,"" she assured me, before giving me the gentle smile I had come to expect from her. ""I""m used to it. Didn""t you see the love letters I got this morning?"" she asked. ""Yes, but..."" I began. I really wanted to apologize to her. She reached out and touched my hand briefly, her smile unflagging. ""It""s really okay,"" she assured me. ""It""s flattering to be liked, I guess,"" she said, though her tone wasn""t entirely sure. ""Do you ever accept any of the invitations?"" I blurted out suddenly.",1112924
2978,"Then the boys see Ranma and they""re shocked. The actor in the godzilla suit says, ""Oh my! You""re Ranma Saotome...heir to the Saotome fortune..."" Then another actor dressed as a man from Edo times says, ""I take it that this lady must be your fiancee"" I guess we have no choice but to give up our pursuit of Akane. The boys run off and Ranma looks at Akane and says, ""At least they stopped..."" Akane then says, ""I could""ve beaten them up without you!"" Unknown to the two, a strange teenager overhears the two and is carrying a huge spatula. Ranma and Akane then enter the building and then they see a strange man in a hawaiian shirt and shorts, he has a tan and a topknot. The strange man has his fingers ties to strings and it is tied to pineapples and guava fruits on the ceiling and he is playing his ukeleilei and making them move up and down and then he sings, ""Keikei would you like some fruits? Keikei would you like some fruits? Keikei would you like some fruits?"" Then he notices Ranma""s pigtail so he goes up to Ranma and while holding scissors he says, ""Demerit fo"" de long hair brudda!"" Then Ranma delivers him a kick to the head and says, ""Who do you think you are? ""Czar Baldy Bald the fourth""?"" The strange man then says, ""What""s da matter brudda? can""t take a JOKE?"" AHAHAHAHA!"" Ranma then asks Akane who was he, then Akane answers, ""Believe it or not, he is the Principal of the school... he has been mysteriously absent for three years when he returned from Hawaii, he came back a few months ago and with an obsession for both conformity and all things Hawaiian, including his very dark skin and a fake Hawaiian accent...and even before he was like this, he liked to play practical JOKES on the students... but if he stays out of line I shall consider him a criminal. Ranma then says, ""I""d rather face Riddler again that have to fight the Prinicipal, he seems to be a martial artist too."" Ranma and Akane then attend the class of Hinako Ninomiya who is starting a lesson on ""ticks, fleas, mosquitos, and other PARASITES"".

So we finally meet, I see I finally met someone who shares the deep commitment of ridding the dark and corrupting city of crime."" Girlman then says, ""Oh and congradulations on being promoted to Comissioner, now what is the clue you wanted me to see?"" Soun then gives Girlman a tiny flashlight that emits a infra-red signal and Soun says, ""Apparently, the criminals you apprehanded have these and they seem to call on someone they call ""The Killer Moth"", he has the same M.O. as you but the opposite, instead of fighting for justice, he fights for injustice. See to it that you can get to the bottom of... huh?"" Soun notices that Girlman vanished into the night...

3175,"This time, it was Ed who spun cooly away, smirk tugging at the corners of his lips at the sight of Greed bent double, a hand pressed to his side. ""Oh, I""m sure I can handle you."" Greed stood back up, and for the first time, Ed saw true anger in his eyes. Without pausing to respond to Ed""s taunt, he attacked again. Ed hopped out of the way, but Greed turned just as quickly, managing to change the direction of his attack with alarming efficiency. Ed tried to block, but another shock of pain hit him as Greed""s fist clipped his shoulder and sent him reeling backwards. Stumbling a bit but managing to keep his balance, Ed could feel the bruise already forming where Greed""s hit had landed. Dammit! Ed thought, as he realized it didn""t matter how good of a fighter he was. Greed had half a foot on him and at least fifty pounds. If he landed one of his punches, Ed would be out. With this thought in mind, he switched strategies, choosing to duck and avoid Greed""s barrage of attacks. Vaguely, Ed heard screams of encouragement coming from the mob of teenage boys surrounding them, though the specifics of what they were yelling were lost on him. Ed moved as much as their tight circle would allow, sweat dripping from his face. He couldn""t keep this up for much longer, and he had no delusions that the sharp jabs and hits that he was managing to land in between Greed""s attacks would be enough to bring the other boy down. It was time to end this. The next time Greed""s arm arched towards Ed, he deftly slipped underneath it and ran to the other side of the circle. Without pausing, he turned, and seeing that the other boy was already barreling after him, he planted one foot into the ground and used it to propel himself into a powerful roundhouse kick. With almost inhuman speed, Greed brought both his forearms up to block Ed""s foot. The resulting connection was enough to knock both boys off their feet. Just as Ed was struggling back up, a couple of guards pushed their way through the throng of bodies and stepped between the two boys. ""That""s enough!"" One of them shouted, glaring at Greed. Greed smirked and held up both his hands, moving away from where Ed still lay on the ground. The other turned towards Ed, and pressed a knee into his chest. ""Stay down, boy,"" he muttered. ""Well, Ed, I guess we""ll just have to finish this later,"" Greed said, and winked at the other boy. ""So Mustang has agreed to represent the little whelp?"" A woman asked. Her voice was low and sultry, something about it oddly compelling. She inspected her nails, as if the answer to her question wasn""t interesting enough to hold her undivided attention. ""Father isn""t going to be happy about this."" From his place across from her, Kimblee chuckled. ""I wouldn""t worry about it. There""s only so much a good lawyer can do with the kind of evidence we have."" The woman looked up, her eyes narrowed into slits. ""This was supposed to be a simple matter. it has gotten completely out of hand."" Kimblee shrugged. ""That""s hardly my fault. I""m not the one who decided to frame the boy.""",2943978
934,"Konichiwa! Thank you for all your reviews! You really helped me. I am making this story longer so it will last about 5 chapters. There will also be crossover characters from Fushigi Yuugi in this chapter, possibly till the ending.Disclaimer: If I own Ayashi no Ceres, Chidori will be alive again! Chapter 3New friends? It was way pass midnight now. The once busy street was now deserted, except for the fact that a certain young man, with long hair, was walking down the road. ""Ashidori mou, Karukushite, chao, chao.."" he started to sing as droplets of rain fell from the sky. ""Argh! Why does it have to rain now that I don""t have any umbrella?!"" he muttered under his breath. He started to run when he noticed something. A girl with long hair was crossing the street, even though the green light was on. There was a truck speeding ahead. ""Watch out!!!"" the man pushed the girl out of the way and jumped to avoid the speeding truck. ""Hey! If you wanted to die, do it somewhere else!"" the driver shouted and sped away. ""Heck! What were you thinking! You almost got yourself killed! Idiot!"" the man approached the girl only to see that she was asleep. ""I can""t leave you here..."" he carried the girl and walked away.----------------------------------- ""Psst, who is that girl?"" ""I don""t know. My brother just brought her home last night."" ""Do you think she is his girlfriend?"" ""She is cute so why not?"" Chidori felt herself lying on a soft bed. Her eyelids were still heavy so she didn""t bother to open her eyes. She tried to remember what happened last night...waking up in her body again, rushing to see Yuuhi, Yuuhi kissing Aya, running away, being saved by a man when she was almost killed... She snapped her eyes open. She was surprised to see herself in an unfamiliar room. She examined the room with her eyes until she saw two people around. There was a young girl with short pink hair and an older man with black hair. ""Um...er...um...good morning?"" the young one said. Chidori sat up and smiled at her, ""Hello!"" ""She""s so cute..."" Chidori heard her say. The older one coughed and it caught Chidori""s attention. ""Um...hello! My name is Chidori Kurama."" The man smiled, ""I am Mitsukake."" ""What is your name? You""re such a cute little girl!"" Chidori asked the young one. Mitsukake started laughing. The young one pouted, ""I am not a girl...And my name is Chiriko."" ""I""m so sorry!"" Chidori apologized. ""You don""t need to, Chidori. Chiriko is always mistaken as girl,"" Mitsukake said after regaining his composure. His face was red from too much laughing. ""Um...why am I here?"" Chidori asked after a while. ""Hotohori said that he saved you from being hit by a truck."" ""Hotohori?"" ""Yes, he is my brother,"" Chiriko explained. Just then, a man with long hair entered. ""Brother!"" ""Hello, I see you are awake,"" Hotohori smiled at Chidori. Chidori could feel herself blushing. ""Tha..Thank you for saving me last night..."" ""Why did you do that?"" Mitsukake asked. ""It""s a long story..."" They sensed that Chidori don""t want to talk about it so they just fell silent. ""Breakfast is ready!!!""",560480
1807,"I""d thought so, but confirmation helped. Two deep breaths. Unknown said they weren""t involved with him, and I believed the stranger. He didn""t have any reason to lie. Three deep breaths. Luciel needed to know. I bolted for my apartment, flying down the stairs and slamming my door closed behind me. Only with the reassuring sound of the electronic lock did I calm down. My heart beat wildly. My palms were sweaty. Eyes wide, I turned to my dancing mirror. I looked like a feral beast, anxiety clawing away at my insides. In a flurry, I dialed Luciel. It went to voicemail. So I dialed again. And again. And again, until on the tenth consecutive dial the hacker""s perpetual-jokester tone filtered in, ""I know I""m amazing and you love me, Aya, but usually when someone doesn""t answer the phone it means they""re busy."" ""Th-the security cameras,"" I clutched at my chest. It felt like I""d run a marathon, when it was only a flight of stairs, ""He was here. He was here, Luciel-!"" ""Whoa, whoa, calm down; who was there?"" I heard something swivel, then rapid typing. I breathed in, slow and deliberate, trying to keep the tightness in my chest at bay. I needed my meds, but they were in the bathroom. That seemed like so far from here... ""The person who gave... wh-who gave me the... the app. H-h-he said he was... he was Unknown!"" ""Well I could""ve told you that; wasn""t too far fetched a connection,"" His voice was half murmur, mostly to himself. Then, everything went silent. Painfully silent. After a long minute, I asked in a quivering voice, ""... Luciel?"" ""What the fuck?"" My shivers returned, ""L-Luciel?"" ""He... he covered my cameras with tape? Who does that?!"" Was that really the issue right now? That man was less than ten feet from me, not three minutes ago! ""Luciel-!"" ""Gimme a bit; I""ll analyze what I can. Came in the elevator, wearing a mask and hood, covered my cameras with tape - that ass - and used a voice modulator to hide his tone?"" Luciel whistled, ""I don""t know if I""m angry, or impressed. Or both. Probably both."" I whimpered. Luciel quieted on the other end, before speaking much softer than before, ""... you okay?"" I shook my head, but against my true feelings said, ""... yeah."" ""Zen""s injured and you""re fighting back a panic attack. Today""s greeeaaaat."" I didn""t say anything. He wasn""t wrong, though the way Luciel said it was a bit callous, ""Okay, okay. Listen, I""m going to look over this footage and see if I can get anything. I doubt it, but I""ll try. I""m gonna need you to take that damn tape off my cameras, though. Maybe move them. This dude obviously knows where they all are."" I held the phone with both hands now, leaning heavily on my door, ""... can it wait until it""s light out? I..."" I looked over my shoulder at the door. It seemed so dark and forboding out there right now, ""... I don""t want to go out th-there right now."" ""What? Oh, yeah, right; that,"" Luciel said, ""Sure, whatever; whenever you get a chance. Hey, you gonna be okay on your own? I""m suddenly finding myself with a lot more work to do."" ""... sorry."" He laughed, ""Sorry?",748687
2009,"""Well he did say to make myself at home"" Brenda poured herself a bow of cereal and sat down, she glanced down and caught a glimpse of David and Steve from a group photo that was taken back in high school, she picked up the picture and smiled. She really did miss David sure they weren""t the closest but they were friends, she glanced at the picture again. She missed David but she missed Steve more, right before she left she felt as if they formed a strong bond. Right before she left they had gotten really close, after the whole Laura thing she saw Steve and their friendship in a new light and she truly did miss him when she left. She had once gotten a letter from him saying that he getting married to this girl named Janet that was pregnant with his child, in the letter he said that he desperately wanted her to come. Of course she never showed, she didn""t even write him back telling that she wasn""t going to come. There was so many things going on with her back then that she didn""t have the courage to write him back, he must hate her, ever since that day her and Steve haven""t talked. A knock at the door pulled her back to reality, she looked over at Dylan, seeing that he was out cold she got up and answered the door herself, and the person that was on the other side made her gasp, it was no other than Steve Sanders. Steve stared back at Brenda with shock in his eyes, she was the last person he had expected to see. The last time he had had any sort of contact with Brenda was when he wrote her a letter inviting her to his wedding and to his disappointment she never showed, she didn""t even have the courtesy to write him back saying that she wasn""t going to show, after that day he had given up on any sort of communication with her, but here she was. ""Brenda? Is that you?"" Steve blinking trying to make sure that it wasn""t a dream. Brenda had expected Steve to be upset, to yell, to holler or to just leave but what he did shocked the hell out of Brenda. He hugged her. He held on to her like this was their last minute together, he wanted to be mad at her but he wasn""t, he was just happy to see her, she was still the same beautiful Brenda. ""My god Bren, when did you get back?"" They sat down in the kitchen. ""Like five or six hours ago"" ""You were the last person I expected to see, I came over here to see Dylan and I got you. I should come see Dylan more often."" Brenda smiled and opened her mouth to say something but closed it again. ""You never showed up. I waited and waited and then I realized that you weren""t going to show"" ""I""m sorry. I wanted to come, I really did. But so many things were going on with me at the time that I couldn""t deal with coming back. So many emotions were going through me and I was... guess afraid to come back. I wanted to write you or call"" ""But you didn""t, why?"" ""I was afraid"" ""Afraid? Well that doesn""t matter or at least not right now. Come on, let""s go"" Steve pulled her up. ""Whoa Steve, where are we going?"" ""The Peach Pit, everyone""s going to be there"" ""Who is everyone?""",29783
1763,"He hissed. Devon muttered something before grunting, ""Sure, we""ll take him to the rink, and watch him spin like a sparkly little pussy."" ""Careful, Mister Brace. I would have for your supply to run out."" A short pause. ""We""ll hang out with Junior tomorrow."" Vance smiled coldly. ""Good."" After hanging up, he turned on the hidden camera in his son""s room. He saw Junior enter, and throw things in disarray, his backpack knocking the laptop on his desk off the edge and under his bed. He kicked off his Timberlands, threw his Rolex to the dresser and stripped off his blazer and dress shirt. Vance sighed. ""Teenagers... so hard to control them."" AK: Ladies and gentlemen, the most helicopter parent ever! Sorry I""ve been gone so long. Sophomore year is hectic. I may start doing just the bi-monthly updates. Max was surprised to see her former boss again, this time near her more frequented cafe. ""Mr. Colter, what a pleasant surprise."" she chirped despite the utter bafflement she felt. ""Maxine, please, call me Vance."" He smiled a smile that didn""t quite seem realistic. ""We are old acquaintances, now. Not boss and employee."" ""I""ll do that..."" Max replied diplomatically. ""What brings you to my side of Gotham?"" ""An overseas investor of mine is staying in Gotham Towers, and suggested lunch to look over a renewal of funding."" Vance replied. ""Ah,"" Max said relieved somewhat. Now she wouldn""t have to spend time with him. ""Then I won""t keep you."" She moved to go around him to go into the trendy coffee shop. ""However, I could use your opinion on something."" Vance""s words stopped her. ""Yes?"" Max asked, sidestepping a small trickle of customers from the coffee shop. ""Is there a nice and safe place for our meeting? A nice restaurant you recommend?"" Max sighed inwardly. Of course, she thought. ""Magnolia""s on 8th Street is pretty nice. And the Lounge has a very safe atmosphere."" ""Go Angie!"" cheered Ricky from the sidelines at Central Rink. Lexi and the girls were watching as Angie and her new Spoke Hydraulic hover-blades showed the Stephen and Jared what it meant to tear up the obstacle track. It was Angie""s birthday, and for it, the gang had chipped in to buy her the new skates- which the girl had not-so-subtly told them she wanted. Like, she told them every week since the beginning of the month. As it was the group""s tradition to pool money and buy one gift, rather than they all try and outdo each other, there was several cards with the one present. Angie had lit up like a megawatt TV set light at seeing the hover-blades, and promptly decreed a birthday celebration at Central to break them in. Stephen and the ever competitive Jared had stepped up to show their mettle against the birthday girl, after everyone else bowed out. As they trio on the private obstacle course neared the line that would signal the fourth and final lap, Lexi""s stomach grumbled. Julie frowned, looking over at her friend. ""Did you feed that thing before we came?"" Lexi shrugged. ""I""ll feed it now. Want anything? ""she asked the group. ""Nachos, large."" Angie yelled over the screen as she passed.",3439302
1188,"I tuned out the sirens, the noise, even those who were asking if I was okay. I just needed to think; that""s what I was good at. However, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn""t pin my thoughts down. They sped along faster then the black van in which I was buckled. Bombarded with worries, passing thoughts, wishes... and images. My imagination was drumming up different pictures; how she would look if we found her, if she was even alive... Then there was my memories. Pictures and images burned into my mind of the time I had walked into her home just to say hello and to tell her that I had gotten accepted into my favorite college. First I had seen a trail of red; being the child I was, I followed it... and found them. That image of their bodies, contorted and nailed to makeshift crossed in their own living room... a vision to haunt my dreams just as my capture at the hands of Tobias had. Even worse were the dreams in which they all melded together... the ones where I was the one nailed to the cross, needles in my arm... with an unquenchable thirst for more. Those ones scared me the most. Then, as my saving grace from these horrifying thoughts, we reached it. The house had not changed that much on the outside... the same white fence, the same porch, the same flowerbeds. The only difference was one window; boarded up so not a slice of light could get through. My mind conjured up images of myself on those steps, of Nephilim and her family tending to the garden. Just as my mind registered them, they were gone. The car came to a halt and I threw myself from it, gun already in hand. The others were slower, but not by much. Once Hotchner came out of the car, he began directing everyone, ""Prentiss, Rossi, you take some of the officers and make your way to the rear. Prentiss, take the left, Rossi, the right. Morgan, Reid, and the others... you""re with me."" We all nodded and set off. As quickly as possible, we went through the fence and up the steps, taking places on either side of the door, guns drawn. There were voices from the inside. One strong male voice and other voices chanting after him. Morgan looked at Hotchner, who nodded his head quickly. He then reached out and tried the door; locked. With another look at Hotchner - who once again nodded - Morgan walked back a few steps before running forward, kicking the door open. Within seconds the rest of us filed in, guns drawn. For a moment, I was stunned. The entryway, which usually was stairs and a hallway, had expanded to encompass the entire house. Like all the walls in the ground floor had been taken away and all that was left besides the four outer walls was the stairs leading up and the stairs leading down into the basement. There was what could be only described as pews throughout the room, all pointed towards the far back, where there was some sort of altar with a large stone statue of Set behind it. The altar held a bloody bundle. We were too late. ""HANDS BEHIND YOUR HEAD!"" Morgan shouted to those near the altar. There was five people; one of which was behind the altar.",748687
1366,"""I didn""t know you guys had to go through something like that and still have each other."" Manny said. ""It""s been a struggle to take care of ourselves, but it was worth it."" Eddie said. ""You know, my mom and dad were killed by human hunters with spears and rocks and everything. They had to kill the two most important people in my life and I was very young when I witnessed that. It still haunts me for so long and how do you see something this horrible in an early age? You might think it would happen to someone else, but not to you. That""s why I became so grouchy and everything, because I had to hide away my true feelings from anyone and that""s even before I met Sid and he""s still a pain in the butt, but he""s very joyful and amazing, which kinda broke down the wall I shut myself in. The same with Diego and with you guys now."" ""We didn""t know that happened to you. How did you find out?"" asked Ellie. ""One time, we were taking a human baby back to it""s family and we stopped in a cave where we found some drawings there and Manny saw three mammoths and it resembles his family and gave us a flashback of a horrible tragedy. At that point, when I saw Manny a little teary-eyed, I knew that he was not such a grouch after all. He""s just a regular guy that needs a friend."" Sid explained. ""Is that true?"" asked Crash. Manny sighed and said, ""Yeah, it""s true. Very true. Although, I didn""t want to have the same thing I have with my kids and end up with them not knowing their own parents."" ""That""s sad. Not as sad as my mom left me behind, because I was too annoying and a nuisance between me and my parents."" Sid said. ""Oh, there""s a shock."" said Diego, sarcastically. ""No, seriously. The reason why they abandonded me, because when I got older, all I did was get on their nerves with my noises, talking and stuff like that. So, I got sent to live with my uncles and cousins, but they get sick of me very easily."" ""How easily?"" asked Ellie. ""Yeah, how easly?"" asked Diego. ""Repeat the same word more than once, beg them to tag along with them and just make some noises at night."" ""So, basically, you""re more annoying than usual than you are now?"" asked Crash. Sid made a face that says, ""you""re joking, right"" and replied, ""Yes, I am."" ""Wow. That""s no surprise."" Manny said. ""What""s your story, Diego?"" asked Eddie. Diego cleared his throat and said, ""Well, where do I start? A few years after I was born, my father died and after that, my mother brought us along to find a new home and when we got there, several days after that, a pack of wolves surrounded our mother and she got out of her way to save us and she fought those wolves like crazy. But, the wolves already defeated our mother and she had one life left and the wolves killed her, straight to her heart. We were feeling a great amount of loss and she left Soto in charge. They grieve pretty quick and we""ve been survivors to fight, kill for food and give orders. Before I met you guys, I became cold-hearted and a villain and after that, I started to be more of a friend and a defender, but still have the hunting skills in me.",1276465
798,"Joey knew she wasn""t heartbroken over Pacey, they had fought so much lately, there had been so much tension and she knew it was only a matter of time until one of them would break it off and Joey had hoped it was Pacey, but in a way it was really her who had ended the relationship. She ended the relationship the minute she picked up that phone, she ended the relationship the second she entered Dawson""s room, she ended the relationship when she fell asleep in Dawson""s arms. ""Could you ever love me like you love him? Pacey was right, she never answered him, back then she didn""t know how to answer that question and she still didn""t. Dawson was everything to her; he was the best friend, the unattainable crush, the boyfriend, the shoulder to cry on... everything. She had loved him for so many years that even when she wanted the love for him to stop, it wouldn""t; it couldn""t. Joey had wanted to hate him so badly when he forced her to send her own father to jail, but she didn""t, she had pretended to but she never hated him, she could never hate him. She had tried not to think of him when she was away with Pacey, she had tried desperately to just let her mind think of Pacey and only Pacey but it didn""t matter what she wanted or what she told herself, her mind always wandered to Dawson. It was like a disease for Joey Potter, she was plagued to love Dawson Leery for the rest of her life, it didn""t matter how many boyfriends she had in the future, she would always measure them up to Dawson, always. ""Joey?"" Dawson gazed at the still crying girl beside him, she seemed to be in deep thought and he really didn""t want to disturb her from it but the odd silence between them was getting to him, he needed noise. Yelling. Screaming. Anything. Anything to get his mind off of putting his arms around Joey and cradling her in his arms and whispering in her ear, he knew he couldn""t do that, that would just make things more complicated for him and Joey. ""Dawson please can we just sit here? I just need to sit here, please stay with me"" Dawson nodded and put his arms around Joey and closed his eyes when she leaned into him, Dawson leaned his head against the wall and swallowed hard when he felt Joey""s hot tears soak through his tee shirt. ""Yeah Joey we can"" Dawson knew that she was already asleep, he knew she probably didn""t hear the words, but he felt as if they needed to be said. Something needed to be said, it was so silent in Joey""s house now, Joey""s whimpers and sobs couldn""t be heard anymore, only the rustling of the leaves outside and his deep breathing could be heard. Pacey threw himself down on his bed, he didn""t even bother to kick off his shoes or take off his coat, he closed his eyes hoping everything would just go away. A day ago, he had everything he wanted; he had Joey, the girl he had fallen in love with and now everything was gone. Pacey didn""t have Joey anymore, did he ever? Did he ever really have Joey? Sure she was there and she was with him but whenever they were together he knew she was somewhere else, or with someone else.",29783
3498,"""Clearly, tennis and boxing require arm strength, and all it would take is a simple calculation of their specific musculature to triangul-"" But Inumuta never had time to finish, instead retracting and almost letting out a startled gasp as Sanageyama forcefully shut his laptop screen. ""NO!"" he declared with fervor. ""I don""t need numbers and ratings! We watch this match live!"" Nonon giggled to herself, finding joy in Inumuta""s plight as the Chief Officer of Information and Strategic Planning scanned his computer feverishly, fearing the worst in damages. Luckily, he managed to calm down once he it seemed Sanageyama hadn""t broken anything. ""I can""t help but wonder,"" Iori, who chosen to remain silent up until this point, asked. ""...is it really wise to trust the prototype uniforms in the hands of these No-Stars?"" Gamagoori turned in an instant, his eyes narrowed as if someone had committed sacrilege. ""You would question Satsuki-sama""s judgment?"" But despite Gamagoori""s death glare, the young tailor seemed unafraid. ""I""m not saying Satsuki-Sama""s wrong. I would never. But they are my handiwork, so I""m just observing that perhaps we should have been a little more selective about who would be granted the first uniforms."" ""Satsuki-sama is doing what she believes is right for this Academy."" Sanageyama replied, cutting off Gamagoori before he could declare any more treason. ""And she""s right to judge things like this. This way, only the strongest student, the one most deserving of a Goku Uniform, will be the student who earns one."" ""This is no contest, monkey. Hakodate is going to win."" Nonon stated, clearly seeing no promise in Takaharu""s performance whatsoever. On the Covered Conquest Tower, the boxer was still a few feet behind Omiko, from what everyone watching from below could see. He was fighting hard to catch up though, his gloves literally creating impressions as he pounded his way after Omiko. No one, not even Sanageyama, could imagine what was going through Takaharu""s head as he worked his muscles to the limit, trying his hardest to catch up with the twin-tailed tennis player. Each punch into the wall created indents that allowed him to maintain his grip, but also allowed him to build momentum and slowly increase in speed. But despite this, Omiko still was up ahead, and gaining her own speed as her delicate fingers held onto to every crevice with ease. She was no experienced rock climber, that much was true. But it was amazing nevertheless what pure determination could bring out in people, and for Omiko, it was bringing every ounce of arm strength and endurance she had to offer. As the tennis player scaled the wall with efficient ease, she could only wonder just how sore her arms were going to be, once this was all over. Meanwhile, behind Takaharu, a few of the other, less-important No-Stars seemed to be gaining headway. Surprisingly, they were actually worked together, forming a sort of human ladder as they helped the last man in their formation up to the top and so on. So distracted was Takaharu, that he didn""t even realize they were coming.",967934
745,"She brushed off the distracting thoughts and grabbed a bottle, starting to wash herself on autopilot. She had precious few minutes alone to figure this thing out and she wasn""t about to waste them away lamenting her vanilla-scented shampoo. Selina knew last night was a terrible mistake and even suspected from his reaction this morning that Bruce knew too. The question was how to avoid letting the awkwardness overwhelm them. How could she face this in the light of day? As she lathered up, the Catwoman in her begin to fire up. Was she kidding? How would she face this in the light of day? She was Catwoman! Five days ago she told the Joker to fuck off and she was worried about some trust fund brat? She would go out there with the same confidence she used to face down Batman and Gotham Rogues alike. She could do this. This could be handled easily. With this game plan firmly in place she enjoyed the remainder of her shower and finished quickly. She got in a bit more of a playful mood after she wrapped herself in the white terrycloth robe. She allowed curiosity to get the best of her and searched through cabinets. Finding nothing of real interest, she walked out to face Bruce. But was met with his butler instead. It threw her for a loop and she found herself off balance for a second, but she recovered quickly. ""Where""s Bruce? Another business emergency?"" The butler straightened, ""No Madame. He""s waiting downstairs with breakfast. He simply informed of your clothing situation and I thought I might offer a solution."" ""Oh."" Selina immediately felt playful again. ""That would be much appreciated. Lead the way."" She smiled brightly and followed him in a near skip. Bruce was scouring over the Business section of The Wall Street Journal. It was mostly for pretense though. His mind was far too focused on berating himself for his behavior last night. How could he allow himself such a lapse in judgment? Before his mind could repeat the same stern speech it""d been giving him since he woke up, Selina walked in, dressed in women""s clothes. ""Hello, Mr. Wayne,"" she said cheerfully. He decided he didn""t want to know how Alfred arranged that and put aside his paper. He gestured to an empty chair, ""Have a seat. Join me for breakfast."" She gave him a bright smile and snatched up a croissant. ""Thank you but I""ll be taking mine to go. Alfred called a cab."" She held out an arm. ""But feel free to escort me to the front door."" Bruce grinned, perhaps too much like an idiot, and got up with far too much eagerness. ""Of course."" He walked her to the door with such a formalness that she was giggling by the time they reached the door. He forced himself to grin widely again. She stopped herself and looked in his eyes. She playfully brushed back some of his hair. ""Just so you know, Mr. Wayne. Last night was a one-time thing, a mistake that will not be repeated."" Bruce let a hint of darkness creep into his voice, ""Of course."" He took her hand and not letting go of her gaze raised it to his lips and kissed it softly. She looked pleased. ""Miss Kyle.""",1497577
3225,"He was not governed by the same laws as man and vampire, but he did fear one thing. The thing he feared most was loss of control. It was the one thing in his mind which he shared in common with those of more normal psychology. So you and I can never really understand Alucard even though we think we can. We can no more understand him than he could have understood himself. But as Alucard gazed into the pink innards of the wizard""s glass he saw what he wanted to know and he knew the orb was showing him the truth. The pleasure of knowledge flooded his damaged brain and in a moment he came in his pants from the grapefruit""s euphoric effect. The only rush greater than that of the orb came from murdering someone. Now that was a good idea at the moment. Schrodinger the Cat was everywhere and nowhere. Despite his seeming omniscience, Schrodinger was not very wise. He was one with many facts but very little comprehension. He was between and outside of the atoms in the universe but he couldn""t really understand any of it any more than the paramecium swimming in a petri dish. It was only when he assumed physical form that he could comprehend, in however limited a fashion. Schrodinger, everywhere and nowhere, was now in the wizard""s glass and he was afraid. The eye of Baba Yaga struck fear in he who would live for as long as he could recognize himself. The truth was that the orb was only showing Alucard half the truth. That was good, for the orbs could be swayed, just as the Major""s contact predicted. Yet, Schrodinger himself was being blocked by the grapefruit. He could be in the past and future and now there was somewhere that he was not. As he tried to sway the grapefruit under his control, paradoxically it became more out of control. Reality was Schrodinger""s universe as the lake is the fish""s universe; and the grapefruit was threatening to pull the Schrodinger-fish from the pond. Schrodinger was born to die so that Alucard could die and become more than an imaginary number. Schrodinger could see the future but the grapefruit was making the future. The outcome which had always been so clear for Schrodinger was now clouded; a side effect of deluding Alucard was that now Millennium should find itself blinded. The blind fighting the insane; how fitting. Schrodinger didn""t know what was going to happen. He only followed orders. But he knew for sure that the grand, glorious battle of annihilation; the fight between the vampires, Millennium, Hellsing and Iscariot was only an opening act to even more world shattering change. It was going to be glorious. That""s not quite the end of that :) There will be a bonus chapter because my fans asked me so nicely. This story has been fun to write and I hope you all enjoyed it. Ta Master of the Boot All the Pretty Things: Strangled at birth Bonus chapter part 1: Hell on Earth Warning: This chapter contains graphic rape and torture.

415,"It makes me sick. Sometimes, I have nightmares but they feel so real that it scares me. I keep telling myself if was only a dream, myimaganation but all the sensations are too real. I""m scared. The days pass by faster now, because I keep dreading the time I finally fall asleep. Will I dream? What will happen this time? I want to know, but I don""t. I want Tsuzuki to save me, but I don""t know how he can. If this keeps going, eventually I""ll never be able to sleep. At that point, I will no longer be able to hide myinsceurties. My stress builds up little my little each day and nothing I have done has provided a releaf for it. Sometimes, when I""m with Tsuzuki, he makes me feel like things will be allright again. Like I""m safe. However, this is just a lie. I don""t feel safe at all. I just feel what he""s feeling. Who am I? Sometimes I can""t even tell anymore. In public, I only focus on Tsuzuki and he guides me through the darkness. Gradually I began to notice that I could no longerseperate my own feelings from his. Do I feel happy at the moment? Or angry? My mind tells me I should feel one way, but I often feel many emotions at once. I think I""m slowly losing it. Barely a month has gone by, and already I feel like my path will lead me to the brink of an endless, cold black hole. Muraki will be coming back for me. If he does not, then he knows that I will go back to him. I have to get to that mansion. If I can""t go back to the person I used to be, then I""m not going to look back on my life. I will give it up. It doesn""t matter if I become his slave or doll, if someone can take this pain away I will gladly serve them until my life is no longer my own. At that point, I""m as good as dead. I will pass on, living in a dream where Tsuzuki and I can be together like it used to be. This must be my minds interpreteration of the illusion fields, a place where one is always happy in the after life. Maybe like heaven, I don""t know. But I can""t go on anymore. I have to go back to my hell. Maybe... this is my penitence for being born and living a failure to my family. I""m begining to think that... maybe, just maybe, my mother was right about me from the start. I left their world and escaped from the pain, if only a little. But now, I""ll be right back where I started and this time, I won""t have a route to escape by. ""It""s irony, I guess, that I would be coming back to the very place I was captured and held by Muraki under another red moon. It""s an unnatural event, out of season, but it must be an omen..."" Hisoka""s voice echoed softly in among the empty, broken down walls of the old mansion. It was typical of a horror like setting, but for a house that hasn""t been cared for in centuries, some dilapidation is expected to occur. Regret filled Hisoka""s mind as he walked through the house. He had left Tsuzuki behind without warning. He made sure that his partner was preoccupied, even if it felt like the wrong thing to do. Everything around him seemed to scream at him for entering. It was like a warning, yet this wasn""t anything he didn""t already prepare for.",583994
1303,"Instead of Mumen Rider I wrote Kamen Rider. My freaking gad. I AM ABSOLUTELY SORRY ESPECIALLY TO THOSE WHO READ IT FIRST XD ; v ; *end* OLA EVERYONE! So I decided to post this one early because I""m going out of the country and might not be able to post anything for a few weeks or months ; v ; It""s also a bit longer and as usual, I didn""t proof-read it /slapped/. I""M SORRY OKAY IT""S LIKE 3 AM HERE. HUHUHUHU I""ll edit it as soon as I re-read it XD and please point out if there are any mistakes/typos you find XD Hope you enjoy this chapter~ Tatsumaki sat down on one of the benches as she waited for Saitama to exit the room where his wound was being treated. Surprisingly, just after a few minutes, he walked out of the room with a huge frown. The esper found this peculiar, so she decided to ask Saitama what happened. ""What""s up with you?"" she asked with an eyebrow arched. With a gloomy voice, Saitama replied. ""My hoodie... got a hole on it, thanks to that weirdo clown."" he muttered. Still confused, Tatsumaki crossed her arms. ""Aren""t you even worried about your wound?"" ""Turns out, I don""t have one. The knife got stuck on my hoodie and not on my back. It explains the hole."" the bald hero replied. ""What the hell!? But I clearly saw that he stabbed you! The knife literally went through!"" ""Well, it didn""t."" Saitama answered flatly, though Tatsumaki obviously wasn""t satisfied with his response. It was just plain weird; he knocked the monster-clown down with a single punch and the knife that was supposed to stab his back didn""t even penetrate his skin. Well, she didn""t really see any blood but it wasn""t the case. What in the world is he? He possessed powers worthy of an S-class, she thought. Saitama noticed that she was staring at him as if he did something wrong. ""Is there something on my face?"" he asked. Tatsumaki simply shook her head. ""No, it""s... nothing."" Saitama stared at her before shrugging. ""Okay."" Maybe he just wasn""t used to it, but not hearing any insults and curse words escape from the esper""s mouth was awfully weird. Ever since they got to the hospital, she had been quiet most of the time. She would only talk if she had questions or when someone talked to her. A random thought crept up his mind as he tried to process what was happening. Tatsumaki might""ve been worried about his ""wound"". Nah, scratch that. There""s no way in hell she""d worry for him. She practically hates him. At least that""s what Saitama thinks. On the other hand, Tatsumaki felt a gust of relief knowing that the bald hero wasn""t wounded at all. It slightly pissed her off, but she is now aware that Caped Baldy was no ordinary hero. It might be hard to admit on her part, but she can""t really deny it now. She glanced back up at him, his face showing no expression as usual. ""How the hell did he get so strong?"" she asked herself mentally. After checking out of the hospital, Saitama placed his hands in his pockets as he looked up at the sky. ""Man, it""s already dark huh? King and Rider must be waiting for me already."" he muttered. ""What?"" Tatsumaki asked.",2750536

Outside Yuuhi""s room, Suzumi will ask someone to check on Yuuhi every 10 minutes. They were all curious to know why Suzumi was so worried. Of course, only Aki knew why...---------------------------------- ""Will I go back there?"" Chidori was sitting near the river. She was reflecting to what Ceres said. It was a nice chance to be with Yuuhi...but... ""Why don""t you want to go back there?"" Chidori was surprised to see her mother. ""Mom?"" ""We heard everything, Chidori. Why don""t you want to go back?"" ""Um..I...I am happy here...with you."" ""Is that the real reason?"" Chidori broke their eye contact. Her mother""s gaze made her feel that her mother can read her thoughts. ""I am just not sure if...if...he wants to see me..."" ""What made you think that he will not be?"" ""He loves someone else..."" ""Does that mean that he will not be happy to see you?"" ""What..What do you mean?"" ""Chidori, even if he doesn""t love you as much as you love him, it doesn""t mean that he will not be happy to see you. Besides, I am sure he loves you too, more than a friend."" ""He doesn""t like girls that look like elementary students."" Her mother giggled. ""Anyway, I think you must come back,"" Her mother gave her a reassuring smile. ""Maybe...I need to go back."" -----Aogiri""s household---------- ""Q-chan, could you-"" ""-Please see what Yuuhi is doing? Yes, madam,"" Q-chan stood up and proceeded to Yuuhi""s room. ""Suzumi-san, why do you keep on asking someone to check on Yuuhi?"" Alex asked. He then poured another glass of sake. ""He is such a kill joy! Chidori will be back. I""ll go and let him be with us,"" Aya stood up and proceeded to Yuuhi""s room. ""Yuuhi! Please open the door!"" Q-chan knocked on Yuuhi""s room. ""Why, Q-chan?"" Yuuhi asked as he opened the door. ""Don""t you want to eat something Yuuhi?"" ""I""m not hungry."" ""Aw, Yuuhi, please! Come with us! We are playing some games. I""m sure Chidori will be back. Maybe there was still something left for her to do, so she was delayed. Please!"" Aya knelt in front of Yuuhi. ""Aya, I don""t want to."" ""Please"" One of the weakest points of Aogiri Yuuhi is that he can""t decline favors made with the ""puppy eyes"". ""Alright. But just a while."" ""Yehey!!"" The three of them proceeded to the living room. As Yuuhi closed the door, Chidori""s body glowed.-------Living Room----- ""Yuuhi, let""s play chess."" Aki challenged Yuuhi. Suzumi gave Aki a questioning stare. Aki just smiled at him. ""Okay, I""ll just get some drinks."" Aya went to the kitchen. ""I""ll help you."" Q-chan followed. Aki and Yuuhi started their game. Toya and Alex were watching intently. ""Check!"" Yuuhi announced after a while. ""Do you really think so?"" Aki let his queen eat Yuuhi""s bishop that checked the king a while ago. ""Argh!!!"" ""You must have a keen eye, you know?"" ""Do you really expect a chef to be good at this game?"" ""Here is your-Ah!"" It happened so fast. Aya arrived with a tray of refreshments.",560480
1154,"He appeared in front of her and took her and now they are gone"" Chapter 5- in love with Fiona Phillips Fi looked around trying to find out where she was but since she was not familiar with the settings around she didn""t know where she was. ""Daniel? I know you""re angry about what happened to you so many years ago but maybe I can help you get vengeance for what happened to you"" Fi controlled the tremble in her voice. Daniel flew above Fi causing her to duck. ""How could you do that for me? Your ancestors not only humiliated me they caused me to lose my own life at an early age. I had a bright life in front of me... I was going to be someone but a nasty joke that they thought was funny ruined that all for me. How are you supposed to help me?"" Fi faced Daniel... cold air was all around her but she did not back away. ""I don""t know how... but name it and I""ll try my best to help. I am so sorry for what happened but we are not responsible for what our ancestors did to you"" ""You can""t help me. I""ve been in this house for so many years because of what your family did to me"" Fi backed away from Daniel. ""What does this have to do with me? Why have you been protecting me?"" ""I""ve seen you. You have a gift... the gift of being able to look outside the box. You are my exact equal... my soulmate"" Fi looked around her settings once more trying to see if there was a way out anywhere. ""There""s no way out... you can look all you want but there is no way out"" Fi took off running. Fi saw a flight of stairs and ran up to them hiding in the closest room she could find. ""We are the perfect match Fiona Phillips. I see you for who you are and not who I want you to be. I love you no matter what... even all of your little quirks I love you. Isn""t that what you want? Someone who loves you unconditionally? Well that is what I would do if you gave me the chance. You can live here with me and we will be happy"" Fi crawled down the stairs and walked into what looked like it would been the living room. ""What? You""re saying a spirit from the 30""s took my sister?"" Jack shook his head in disbelief but then the flash of Daniel flew through his head. ""How do we get her back?"" Clu, Carey and Annie looked at each other in shock that he believed what Annie had said. ""Help me! Jack!"" Jack turned his flashlight back on running through the rooms following Fi""s voice. Carey leaned down and saw a blue print. Carey stretched the blue print out and pointed to the east. ""She""s in the living room... over here"" Jack, Clu, Carey and Annie ran into the living room and felt cold air surround them. ""He""s here"" The wind blew Jack back. ""Carey!"" Fi ran up to Carey. ""Thank god you""re okay"" Fi remained in Carey""s arms... Clu and Annie ran over to Carey. ""Fi!"" Fi smiled at Clu and Annie and they all ducked when Daniel flew over them. ""What does he want Fi?"" ""Me. He says I""m his soulmate... where""s Jack?"" ""Does it matter where he is dear Fiona? He always disappointed in you anyways.

2672,"Clara turned around again to finish her cooking then, turned the stove off. ""It""s called longganisa here. It""s pork and it""s quite delicious!"" She said in her usual cheery voice. Then, Alfred kissed her quickly. Clara was a bit shocked; Alfred chuckled at her blushing face. ""Morning kiss."" He said then, went back to the dining room, leaving a dumbfounded Clara in the kitchen. Moments later, breakfast was ready and Alfred was jumping like a kid. ""Yippee! Breakfast!"" He exclaimed causing Arthur to face palm himself. Clara simply smiled at him and served his share. She did the same with Arthur""s plate then her""s. ""Well then, eat!"" She said but Alfred has beaten her in to it. Guess he""s really hungry, Arthur and Clara thought. Arthur took a bite on the longganisa and somehow, his face lightened a bit. Clara was suprised so she asked him, ""Did you like it, kuya Arthur?"" She asked innocently. ""Of course. But still, it""ll be better if I cooked it."" He said with a proud grin. ""Put a cork in it, Arthur! Just by judging your scones made me twitch!"" Alfred said with the mouth full. Unfortunately, the Brit understood this. ""Sh-shut up you bloody git! You""re burger tastes like crap than mine you know!"" Clara glared at them. ""Kuya Arthur, no cursing!"" She scolded that made him shut up and eat again. Alfred laughed and sticked his tongue out at him. ""You too, kuya Al. Stop that."" This time, the Brit tried not to laugh. After breakfast, Clara cleared the table, Arthur helped him and Alfred called for the couch to read a comic book. Arthur sighed and gave Clara the look of apology. ""Don""t mind him. I simply didn""t know where I went wrong when raising him as a gentleman."" Clara smiled back at him. ""Honestly, I""ll miss that attitude a lot."" She replied that made him shocked. ""You""ll miss him? Why? Is he leaving you?"" Clara blushed lightly and turned to him to reply. ""Um... what I meant was... um... if I ever get my impendence, that is."" Her last words gave him a hint of sadness. ""You wanted to be free from him...?"" Clara gave him a baffled look. ""N-no! I-I mean, I simply wanted t-to be free like him! I don""t want to be hindrance in his way. And I""ve always wanted to feel what it is to be independent!"" She admitted with a red face. Arthur chuckled. ""You know, I would""ve granted his independence if he were to answer me that polite."" Clara stared at him for a while. ""Independence..."" LATER~ In Clara""s room, she laid down carelessly and began thinking of the consequences if she were to be independent. ""Of course, I""ll lose him. He""ll be away from me all the way to the other side of the world. Kainis! Ayaw ko namang mapalayo kay kuya.' She thought sadly. Later, she sat at the corner of her bed, hugging her knees. Suddenly, she felt a tear roll down here cheek. ""Crap. Am I crying? Bwisit. I am so weak."" She whispered to herself. ""I""ll miss everything. His smile, his touch, his eyes, his voice... his presence! Diyos ko po, lahat!"" She said, not whispering this time still, tears were flowing down her cheeks.",2750536
3709,"""I am your brother, Kit. You""re twin brother, in fact."" ""Yes, and I""m not letting my child,"" she had patted her still flat stomach meaningfully, ""hang out with their weird uncle."" Jacques had wanted to ask if she was planning on letting her child spend time with its weird, workaholic father, but knew better than to criticize her romantic decisions. The last time he""d expressed such a concern had ended about as poorly as it possibly could. Despite his current mission, he still hoped he could avoid Olaf, not wanting to see the man who""d once been a friend but had since then caused his family to implode for a period of time. Kit had almost completely recovered, Olaf""s promise of a last kiss still haunting her, but Lemony never really had. He still desperately loved Beatrice, despite making peace with her marriage and children as well as her death. Lemony would never get over what his once best friend had done to the woman he loved. Many in VFD believed Lemony dead, but Jacques didn""t. Neither did Kit. They knew their brother. He was no great fighter, but he was the best ran and hider in the world. Lemony had spent most of his life on the lam, probably more of it than anyone else. He could survive anything. He would survive them all. Olivia was now driving, as she had committed to the VFD after he had told her the entire story, even taking her to the Baudelaire fire. Jacques knew he should probably sit in the back seat to keep up the illusion of a cab, but he also knew she was still in training, so he rode beside her. From this new position, he could smell her better, the scent of old books and ink from stamping library books. It was a good scent, one he quite liked. Jacques kept his eyes on the road, trying to ignore the pretty woman at his side and focus on the mission. She had called him sturdy, he remembered. It didn""t seem like much of compliment, but it had felt like the best one he""d ever received. He noticed her eyes kept drifting shut, so he guided her to park the car behind a billboard. ""We can wait here for the night. Get some rest, Olivia Caliban. You""ll need it when I""m through with you."" He nodded to the back seat. He thought he saw a blush stain Miss Caliban""s cheeks. He found it to be adorable and it made her hair look more vibrant, bringing out the red in it. Then he thought through his last words to her, he kept making that mistake, kept accidentally insinuating something between them. He wished he could stop it, but he also didn""t want to. She hesitated as she reached for the door handle, ""What about you?"" ""I""ll be fine,"" he nodded to the road. ""I""ll keep a lookout."" Olivia bit her lip, but nodded. She climbed in the back, curled up and closed her eyes. He could tell it took her awhile to actually fall asleep. It often did when someone""s mind was filled with worries and reflections on previous failings. Against his better judgement, Jacques kept looking at her sleeping figure in the rearview mirror. She looked so beautiful, like a princess in a fairy tale.",1497577
227,"The priest was asking Anastasia the same question. ""I do."" she said calmly, though there was a slight shake in her warm hands. ""I now pronounce you husband and wife. You,"" the priest said with a glint in his eye, ""may kiss the bride."" Anastasia handed her boquet of roses and daisies to a friend of hers. Willy lifted the yards of veil that separated them. For a split second, he looked into her dark eyes, which he realized were the color of dark chocolate. Then, he kissed her. The spell was broken. Cheers thundered through the room as their lips separated. ""Let""s go have some cake!"" Anastasia whispered. They hurried back down the aisle, trying to dodge the rice being thrown. The reception was a big hit. Most of the pictures taken involved people with chocolate cake frosting on their mouths (Anastasia insisted on chocolate cake). Anastasia and Willy took up space on the dance floor quite a bit. As it turned out, Anastasia knew a lot of dance moves and Willy could scarcely keep up with her. By the time the reception was over, he was quite red in the face and quite out of breath. Anastasia giggled and fanned him with a paper plate. ""Whatsa matter, Willy? Can""t keep up?"" Anastasia teased. Willy didn""t answer-he was gulping down some water that some generous soul had passed him. The time came for them to (GASP!) leave the factory for the honeymoon. Rose was left in the care of Mr. and Mrs. Bucket. Willy wasn""t that comfortable with riding in an airplane. Despite the fact that he could ride the glass elevator without flinching, he was violently airsick after a short time and spent most of the ride with his head buried in Anastasia""s lap while she ran her fingers through her hair. He groaned when they got off, knowing he would have to ride it again when the vacation was over. ""Feeling better?"" Anastasia asked when she helped him up. Willy leaned on Anastasia""s shoulder to steady himself. ""If I never see another airplane again,"" Willy said, swallowing hard,"" it will be entirely too soon."" Anastasia giggled. Willy looked over at her. Anastasia""s veil was gone, but she was still wearing her dress. ""First things first,"" Anastasia said, lifting her skirts to avoid dragging it in the dirt, ""I need to get out of this dress before I spill something on it or step on it or tear it or something else happens to it."" They checked into their hotel. ""What a room!"" Willy exclaimed, seeing a hot tub and a huge bed decorated with rose petals. ""Yeah. I made the reservations."" Anastasia said with a smile. She tried to unzip the back of her dress, but couldn""t reach it. ""Willy-"" Anastasia started to ask. Willy ran his hand over the soft lace and satin on Anastasia""s back, then unzipped the dress. The material fell gracefully, and Anastasia stepped out of it. She changed into a more casual dress, and Willy changed his clothes. They went sight-seeing the first day. They went to the beach the second day. ""Willy, I swear, you are as bad as I am!"" Anastasia giggled when Willy continued to try and hide behind his towel. ""I don""t see you taking yours off!"" Willy complained.",870118
3289,"Chapter 15 Rei waited for Yuuya to fall asleep, peering carefully behind him. Yuuya looked peaceful in his slumber. Sitting up from his former position, Rei contemplated on everything that had happened in the night. He didn""t appreciate what Akai had done to him, realizing the fact that the redhead was definitely the one who spiked both of their drinks. It was a stupid idea of trusting him in the first place. But Rei had realized something that night. He turned to his side, gazing gently at the blonde sleeping beside him. His eyes looked almost sympathetic over him for some reason. Yuuya...I don""t think I""m ready for this... Rei looked outside of their window, staring at the moon outside. Do you really want me? Or will your desire only pass by? Will you throw me out of your life when time will come by? He returned his gaze to his hands, staring at the light collecting in his hands like dew. I don""t even know how I would treat you...as a brother or...as a friend...or even a lover...And I don""t know either how you would want me to treat you... Gently, he slid out of the sheets of Yuuya""s bed and slowly tucked them back, securing Yuuya from the cold of the night. He noiselessly collected the clothing he kicked near the mirror and then silently padded on the floor, coming to Yuuya""s side. ""I need some time, Yuuya...just not now. And maybe you also do..."" Rei whispered, hesitating for a moment before kissing the blonde on his forehead, then walked out towards his room, shutting the door softly. ""Rei..."" Yuuya moaned in his sleep, crying, dreaming of him walking out of his life. Yuuya slowly woke in the morning, rubbing his head ruefully from the after effects of the alcohol. But before anything coherent could pass through his mind, his first thoughts were towards the brunette sleeping beside him. ""Rei? Are you..."" Yuuya looked towards his side, but all he saw was the unruffled portion of his bed. ""Was it...just a dream?"" Yuuya looked around, trying to find evidence that Rei had been with him during the night. But it was in vain. ""Sigh...maybe the alcohol got to me..."" Yuuya dug his head in his hands, moaning in complete apathy to life. Taking the sheet of his bare body, he slung a towel on his shoulder. ""Wait a minute..."" He slowly reached out towards a dark pile of clothing on the corner. He gazed dramatically at what he clutched on his hand; it was the leather pants (obviously worn last night). ""So it wasn""t a dream...yes, I did recall Rei telling me to come with him to that karaoke bar...and I got drunk..."" Yuuya clutched at his head, pain mildly shooting through it. ""I can""t remember anything after...damn that drink..."" He slapped his head soundly, swearing at that cursed drink. Dumping the pants and the sweater (which he swore he also wore last night) in the laundry basket, he walked out of his room and towards the bathroom nearby. The door to the bathroom opened all of a sudden as Yuuya was just preparing to wait. He almost fell back, had he not taken balance. Rei exited the door, looking only surprised but then regained his strict composure.",583064
57,"""Right away,"" the waiter said, before leaving. ""So, what""s bothering you?"" Brad asked. ""You""ve been distracted ever since we got here."" Randy stalled, by taking the cloth napkin and placing it neatly on his lap. Brad did the same, though not with the same level of attention. ""Come on, Randy. Tell me."" ""Okay, okay,"" Randy said. ""I was just thinking about our marriage. I mean, is that all it is to you? Free housing?"" Brad shook his head. ""Of course it""s not,"" Brad said.

With Brad""s other hand, he pulled something out his coat pocket. It was a small, royal blue velvet box. Brad pulled a small, royal blue velvet box out of his pocket. Randy felt like a teenage girl getting asked out on her first date; the excitement, enthusiasm and overwhelming nature of it almost threw him for a loop. He stopped to take a drink of water, before reaching out for the box. A wedding ring, or was it an engagement ring? Both? Randy wasn""t sure exactly how those things worked, but it didn""t matter. He would take what he could get. Randy""s imagination ran wild, as he flipped the little box over in his hands. He thought he heard Brad call his name, but Randy was too distracted to notice. What kind of ring would Brad get him? Surely not one too girly or feminine, but if it had a few diamonds inset into a band, Randy wouldn""t exactly say no. Diamonds were everybody""s friend. His hands shook slightly as they pried the lid and base apart, opening the box slowly. Randy held his breath... And immediately took a dumbfounded one. It was a large, golden class ring, belonging to the University of Chesterfield. The school crest was emblazoned with what Randy assumed to be the school colors: emerald green, grey and crimson. A small image of some sort of bird (possibly a phoenix, Randy couldn""t be sure) was staring back at him from the center of the crest. He looked back at Brad, who was beside himself with pride. Apparently, he thought this was the best gift ever, and Randy (not for the first time) was reminded of just how alike Brad and their father were when it came to dolling out gifts at birthdays and holidays. When Randy didn""t speak, Brad""s smile faltered. ""Don""t you like it?"" Brad asked, concerned. ""There are two things in my life I care about, and that""s soccer, and you. When you wear this ring-"" Brad stopped to cover Randy""s hands with his own, keeping the small box confined. ""This ring symbolizes my love for soccer and when you wear it, it""ll be like you""re supporting me. It""ll always keep us connected."" Randy grinned. ""Well, at least until you graduate."" Brad smiled. ""Well yeah, then I""ll just have to win you some sort of championship ring then, won""t I?"" Randy shook his head, but pulled Brad in for a kiss.",583994
245,"He walked away, leaving Mookie feeling a little distraught. He might make himself feel better by singing a little song. He brought out his guitar and strummed it and sang to himself feeling a little lonely and misunderstood. He thought of his mother and makes it better with a song he wrote a few years ago. Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face You told me how proud you were But I walked away If only I knew what I know today Ooh-ooh I would hold you in my arms I would take the pain away Thank you for all you""ve done Forgive all your mistakes There""s nothing I would do To hear your voice again Sometimes I wanna call you But I know you won""t be there Ohh, I""m sorry for blaiming you For everything I just couldn""t do And I""ve hurt myself by hurting you Somedays I feel broke inside But I won""t admit Sometimes I just wanna hide Cause it""s you I miss And it""s so hard to say goodbye When it comes to this Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah Would you tell me I was wrong?Would you help me understand Are you looking down upon me? Are you proud of who I am? There""s nothing I wouldn""t do To have just one more chance To look into your eyes And see you looking back Ohh, I""m sorry for blaming you For everything I just couldn""t do And I""ve hurt myself Ohh, If I had just one more day I would tell you how much that I missed you Since you went away Ohh, it""s dangerous It""s so out of line To try to turn back time... I""m sorry for blaming you For everything I just couldn""t do And I""ve hurt myself... Mookie strummed the guitar and finished the song with a tear in his eye and his voice broke. By hurting you Then, he started to cry and walked back to the log while everyone was sleeping. He laid down and fell asleep with one tear shed down from his face, thinking about his mom. That song was ""Hurt"" from Christina Aguilera. I felt it was a very sweet and gentle song for Mookie. Read and review, please! Chapter 5: Comforting Mookie The next morning, Mookie went through his pictures of him and his mom, spending time when he was a kid. He laughed to himself and sniffled a little. He wiped his eyes and said, ""Man, I miss her so badly."" Heather walked past him and said, ""Hi. Can I sit with you?"" Mookie stared at her and nodded his head. She sat next to Mookie in a rock and said, ""What are you doing?"" ""Looking through my pictures so just me and my mom having fun. I""ve had such an awesome childhood. Now that she""s gone, I just feel like I""ve got no one around me."" said Mookie. ""Well, you have us."" said Heather. ""Not according to Verne. He told me last night that I would be better off somewhere else and that you like me better than him. I don""t take anyone""s place as leader. I didn""t mean to leave him out in the cold."" said Mookie. ""That""s just the way Verne is. He""s afraid that everything will change when there""s new people here. Just give him some time and he""ll get used to you."" said Heather. Mookie sighed and said, ""I don""t know, Heath. I don""t think he likes me. I don""t know what else to do.""

""Your getting better,"" Nefertiri said in Egyptian with a frown on her face from the hatred she had for her sister. ""I""ve been better for a long time, beside today I""m having an off day but if I wasn""t you be meat for the crocodiles by now dear sister,"" Jamila said in Egyptian and with an evil glare at her sister pulling her up and then pulling her hand away like she had touched something hot or very disgusting. ""I think those daggers of yours are the only thing keeping you from losing your matches against anyone,"" and with that Jamila spinned on her foot and held the dagger at her throat and in gritted teeth said, ""Daggers are not the only thing keeping me alive sis, I have a mind, a heart, and the reflexes of a cobra and the senses of a bird so do not comprehend me or you will find yourself next time eating the bugs that find their way into your tomb."" Seti came trotting down as he watched his other daughter point her silver dagger at her sisters throat as well, but Imhotep made it to them before he did and pulled them away and put there hands down to their sides. Seti then told Imhotep he could step back and let him handle his own daughters. Imhotep only nodded keeping his emotions hidden from Seti and pretty much he had hate all inside of him for this man. This man only truly loved his eldest daughter Nefertiri but had very little love for his youngest daughter Jamila, who was only fifteen. But Imhotep filled in that gap for Jamila and sometimes he swore that Jamila should have been his because in so many ways she was like him. Imhotep wished he had a say in Jamila""s life then he could really make sure she be put to her real potential as a fighter and as a very good priest to tell you the truth. Besides she already knew so many curses and had even laid one on her father once and it was still there. It was a curse to bring about bone quivering or in better terms he couldn""t really hold a sword well that more because his hand didn""t have any strength for it. He knew that tonight was the night that the plan was going to go down and then when Seti was killed and Anck-Su-Namun was resurrected he would take both of those girls as far away as possible. He knew this had to go down tonight or Anck-Su-Namun would be married tomorrow and Jamila would be put with the suitor that Seti had chosen for her. He was actually here right now. He was a man about nineteen and he was a so-called heir to the pharaoh up in the upper regions of Egypt. He was a tall and well-tanned man and he was also very strong. He had a ponytail of hair on the left side of his head and his eyes where the shade of brown. He had also had that look of lust in his eyes when he looked at both of Seti""s daughters but he had chosen Jamila because she was younger and had more energy in her and probably because she had more time to give him heirs.",806976

""For a while, she became a sort of symbol for the missing persons department. But since the investigation produced zip, the case was eventually marked as unsolved and put away."" Lilly felt tears well behind her eyes. She did not know whether this was due to the alcohol or her headache or to Will""s story - probably to all three of them -, but she suddenly felt very gloomy. It was a sad story. The Russian girl, who had never done anything wrong, had ended in a grave only a few yards away from her house, while everyone had thought she was a scheming bitch. And the story of her life had been jotted down in notes in some case file that was now buried somewhere in the basement of the building, doomed to be forgotten in time. Lilly caught herself humming a song by Aerosmith called ""Fallen Angels"". ""There""s a candle burning in the world tonight... For another child who vanished out of sight... Where do fallen angels go? I just don""t know... They keep falling..."" ""Lilly?"" Chris was beside her and put his hand on her arm. ""Are you alright?"" Lilly blinked the tears away. ""Sure,"" she said a little bit too cheerfully. ""I was just listening to Will""s story. Why don""t you go ahead, Will?"" Chris cast her another long glance, but Lilly only smiled. ""Been a long day,"" she said. ""I""m tired. Don""t look at me like this."" Chris frowned, but he did not speak. Lilly pulled herself together and turned back to Will. ""Did your colleagues talk to everyone in the community?"" she asked. ""No,"" Will answered. ""I think they only talked to the Jarvis""s. After all, it was them who had laid the information against Natalya, and it was in their house where the theft was committed. And before you ask, I don""t think they knew about the rumor,"" he added when Lilly opened her mouth to speak again. ""They would""ve made a note in the case file if they had known about it."" ""So they didn""t know anything more than we do now,"" Lilly concluded. ""In fact, they knew even less,"" Will corrected. ""They didn""t even know she was dead."" ""Missing person and theft,"" said Lilly. ""Little wonder that I didn""t find the file when I was looking for it in the cold case files."" ""Sorry I couldn""t help you,"" said Will apologetically. ""Sometimes even my memory is not good enough. But I reckon even an elephant couldn""t tell you more about the case as it was back then. There was really not much."" ""No one""s reproaching you,"" Lilly said with a smile. Will smiled back. ""I""m very glad to hear that,"" he said. Then he downed the rest of his beer and got up. ""It""s time for me to go,"" he said. ""My wife""s gonna think I was mugged on the way home or something. It""s way too late, anyway."" Lilly glanced at her watch and was surprised to see that it was already past eleven. But once she knew the time, she noticed how tired she was. She yawned and stretched. ""Tired, eh?""

Eddy then uses the power to turn all of his textbooks into gold and he says ""I never did like homework anyway... I got a idea involving the trailer park...MUAHAHAHA!"" Eddy then goes to the ""Park n Flush Trailer Park"" and yells out ""HEY SKANKER SISTERS! TRAILER TRASH! AHAHAHA!""

3535,"His red eyes burned into Seras""s soul. ""Mark my words, the price of victory is never too high,"" these were the words of a man driven by hatred; consumed by a loathing for a world that neither wanted him nor appeased him. No other King or Queen of Vampires had so easily and thoughtlessly killed the ancient vampires nor had anyone had the audacity to endow themselves with grandiose titles like ""Sacred Ancestor"". It was illogical, all-consuming contempt; especially for those who dared to call themselves his ""peers."" ""I never care how high the cost may grow, I will win."" He growled. He breathed in as if the confession had tired him. Then he gave her a sly smile. ""And if I can be completely honest with you. I don""t just expect casualties, I look forward to them."" In a precise motion, Alucard picked up his work glasses and grabbed his pen as he took the first of the day""s documents. As he violently scratched the pen across the paper, he issued order to his servant. ""Make me happy, Servant, tell me that my judicial system has found Natalie Romanov guilty of sedition and that traitorous whore was raped, skinned alive, raped again, chained in silver and left to either burn in the sun or to starve into dust in a dark cellar."" His Romanian accent was clipped and curt. Seras wasn""t sure how to reply. ""The Romanovs are dead, my master."" Alucard did not look up from the papers he was signing. ""That is not what I asked nor the answer I wanted."" ""Master, Natalie and her family were already dead by the time your assassins got them."" Alucard looked up. The glasses on his face magnified his eyes far beyond their true size. ""What did you say?"" Seras hid her fear, pretending to be as unflappable as the Captain. ""The Romanovs were murdered by an unknown assailant and evidence is inconclusive."" ""Who was it?"" he demanded, ""Who has saved the bitch Natalie from my wrath? Seras shook with fear at her master and handed him the reports from the scene of the crime. Glaring and growing angrier by the minute, Alucard scanned the police reports as well as the summaries by his sorcerers and scientists. ""NOTHING!"" he roared and threw the papers aside. It wasn""t like him to lose control outside of his free time mentality. ""Useless bureaucracy!"" He made as if to strike Seras but he stopped. Seras recoiled, afraid of being struck as well as afraid of being punished for dodging a strike. In Alucard""s mind, the wheels were turning and a plan was being churned out from his corrupt brain. And to the great surprise of Seras Victoria, he began to laugh. The madman was laughing unrestrained. He laughed the laughter of a killer; a laugh full of blood and joy. On his own he""d seen what his investigators had now. He had an epiphany. ""They were picking a fight with me!"" he shouted gleefully, throwing his hands in the air as if conducting an invisible orchestra. He saw the confusion on his secretary""s face and he explained as he dragged her over his desk and pulled her into a hug. ""Oh happy woman,"" he gushed, ""Someone has killed the Romanov family in order to make me blame the Vatican.",1220273

With that, Hue was back in the sea of partying. Garu made his decision and dove into the crush again. He didn""t need Hue to tell him what he already knew. Pucca was a bit nervous to go on stage. Not that she had stage freight; but these were her friends and family. And she was going away for a long time. Suddenly, someone grabbed her arm and twisted her around. Just as she was going to counter it, lips smashed down on hers. She giggled with glee. She""d know those lips anywhere. ""Garu!"" she whispered. ""I...I won""t talk until you come back. I""m taking a vow of silence until your back. And then- And then, I have something to tell you."" Pucca""s heart softened into mush as she was pulled back by Kim. ""You""re on, superstar.""

""Well, now on a serious note... I""m leaving Sooga Village."" ""What?!"" ""Why?!"" ""Dada- did you know about this?!"" Pucca waited until they calmed- and when that became impossible, she nodded to Xavier who struck a loud cord from his guitar into the mike. ""Thank you.

And now Kim with an update."" Bags in the truck, seven-hundred goodbyes said, and one promise of an invite to the premier later, Pucca was on a private jet heading for stardom. Garu sat on the Goh-Rong steps and sighed raggedly. Abyo and Ching passed by, only to find out that he was in a vow of silence. Garu frowned at the disappearing streak in the sky. He wanted her back; so badly. And now, not even Tobey""s attacks could distract him. Abyo had jokingly said, ""You""re so gone, dude."" And then proceeded to begin ripping off his Kung-Fu shirt, only to have Ching skip by with Won on her head. Garu sighed again. He was gone; or at least his heart was...

Review, please Funny Love Pucca stepped off the plane and onto Sooga. Immediately, she was swarmed by her friends and family. ""Pucca,"" Ching cried, wrapping her best friend in a bear hug lethal to all humans. Pucca smiled through the pain, knowing Ching was partially trying to keep her here. ""I missed you Ching. I missed all of you. Hollywood is sooo cutthroat- its always ""say this, do that, put more passion into that scene""! Luckily I wasn""t in the cast of Jersey Shore."" ""Did you meet Channing Tatum?""

We can have so much fun together."" ""Why?"" ""I""m sure Batman doesn""t go around looking for sidekicks and beautoful broads to throw over his shoulder. This way I will have you, I will have something..."" He leaned downward, elbows on his knees, the knife slowly began to cut. Her breath hitches and she let out a heated moan. ""Violent."" He ground out in a animalistic tone. She moaned his name when the blade carved deeper into her skin. He chuckled, removing the blade, he threw it to the side and bringing his mouth to lick up the blood dripping down her wrist. When it was gone, but kept profusely running from the fresh wound, he licked his lips looking up at her. ""Yes. I""ll do it."" She only said yes, because she wanted to help him. She had shot someone before so that wouldn""t be hard, but keeping his attention would, staying alive would deem difficult. ""Perfect. Now go get dressed in something you think I""ll like and bandage up that wrist."" She stood and left the living room doing as he instructed, she didn""t really have anything he""d be interested in. She bandaged up her wrist, going though her closet afterwards, she found something. It was originally something her friend got for her so she could show off to her boyfriend. It was pretty much stripper wear, but it was her favorite colors red and black. A bright red ballerina like skirt that was poofy at the ends. Long fishnet black stockings that went down into leather boot heels that zipped up to below her knees. Black Lace went down the sleeves from the red sports bra that fit very tight to her breasts and showed off her flat stomach. Fingerless black gloves, she put her hair up into pony tails and to appease the Joker. She put white makeup on her face, black around the eyes to make it like a mask, and beat red lipstick. She stepped over to the door and exited the room taking a deep breath and hoping he would enjoy it. When she exited, his back was to her, he was wearing his coat again and scavenging through the fridge. She made a fake cough, placing her hands on her hips and smiling brightly in his direction. He turns to her, freezing he dropped the plate he had held in his hands, it fell to the ground breaking into pieces. She smirked since he wasn""t particularly a man to surprise easily. She leaned into the wall of the hallway and seductively winked at him. ""Fuck me..."" He said under his breath, stepping slowly over to her, looking her up and down. ""Look at you."" He growled lowly, arousal in his tone, lust in his eyes. ""When I told you to get ready I wasn""t expecting this. No wonder you took so long.""",6234395

A second after she speaks, Emma cringes inside because she has just gone there. Religion is one topic she""s learned never to touch on, because it""s one thing almost everyone feels fervent about. She""s getting too comfortable with Mary Margaret and forgetting to think before she speaks. ""No."" The response is immediate, but Mary Margaret lifts a hand to finger the gold cross at her throat. ""But I think they might be a part of God."" The dichotomy of Mary Margaret holding a knife in one hand and her cross in her other crystallizes in Emma""s mind, and suddenly she knows this will be the mental image she always thinks of when someone mentions Mary Margaret. Emma Swan is too old to find it cool to dress up for Halloween, but it""s free candy. She""s eleven and stuck wearing a second-hand Snow White costume. Virginia - her current foster mother - found the costume at the Salvation Army, and actually took the time to pin it up so it almost fits. She knows she doesn""t look right, since who ever heard of a Snow White with blonde hair, but it""s better than cutting eye holes in a sheet. Virginia and Carl are some of the better foster parents she""s had. They""re not forcing her to take her two younger siblings trick-or-treating, but had instead elected to make her a deal. If she takes Bernie and Jaminda with her, they""ll excuse her from doing chores for three days. Since she hates doing dishes, it""s an easy deal for her to make. Plus the free candy. Lark Tree Lane is a working class neighborhood, but Emma feels safe walking outside at night. The people are friendly, and most of them keep their lights on. She marks the couple houses that don""t, and wonders if the residents are going to wake up to find ""tricks"" have been performed to their trees with toilet paper. She would be tempted to go out to play with the big kids, but her foster parents would notice. She shepherds the kids from house to house, not bothering to hold their hands but keeping an eye on them. She lets Bernie take a pee in Mrs. Schroder""s hedge (there""s no light on so the old lady won""t see it), and keeps repeating assurances that Jaminda makes the cutest kitten ever. Both of the kids are being good, and their bags are filling up in a satisfying fashion. She""s gotten too many sweet tarts and not enough actual chocolate, but she can make the others trade her for them. She""s just about ready to turn around and march them home when they""re cornered by three boys wearing cheap plastic masks, the kind that the school programs warn against for fear of suffocation. She thinks she knows who the one in the Yoda mask is, but she""s not one hundred percent sure. The boys are chuckling in an unpleasant fashion, and she knows what""s about to happen. The bigger kids steal their candy. Emma""s reflexes aren""t quick enough to close her fingers over the fragile Wal-Mart bag, and the one wearing the George H.W.

Satoshi laughed apologetically and clasped his hands on the back of his head. ""Anyway, I am early today because I figured that this is going to be the most important day of your life. So I got up real early to help you."" He said bluntly. I crossed my eyebrows a bit. ""Gee, thanks."" I said with a heavy implication of sarcasm. Satoshi chuckled.

In our school, we are not one to turn away from any students based on race, sex, religion, ethnicity or any kinds of backgrounds they have. They came for knowledge and will make a difference in their lives and it only took one person who discriminated against it to go to extremes to end it, worrying about their ""popularity"". We will keep investigating this issue until further notice."" Principal Gonzalez added. ""Of those 21 kids that were injured, 16 year old Brent Rodriguez was shot in the arm by Jesse after Brent pushed Lars out of the way before Jesse could pull the trigger. It""s unclear whether he survived or not, but we will find out the details.",1276465
2196,"Tyler half-smiled but his mind was really on Jamie. ""Remember what Jamie?"" Catie repeated her question when all she got was silence from Jamie; she lifted her head up and tilted to Jamie""s direction to see what look was on his face and it was a mix from confusion and fear and that scared Catie. ""What happened Jamie?"" ""Oh geez Catie, how can you not remember? I can""t stop thinking about it and you can""t remember it?"" Catie stopped looking at Jamie and turned around despite how much it hurt; Jamie cursed himself mentally at how his voice had sounded, it had sounded so harsh, so mean. ""I didn""t mean it like that Catie, I""m just shocked that you something that horrible has been erased from your memory but hey maybe that""s a good thing, sometimes knowing is not for the best"" ""And sometimes not knowing is even worse; I""m in a hospital bed Jamie and every time I move one little muscle in my body this unbearable pain shoots through my body and I feel weak and hurt and I don""t know why, how can not knowing what happened to make me feel this way be better?"" Jamie looked at Catie helplessly; he bit his lip and touched Catie""s back. ""Somehow we""ll get through this, it doesn""t matter how we do just as long as we do it together"" Catie turned around slowly and smiled. ""Agreed but you have to help me remember, I have to know"" Jamie interlocked his hand with hers. ""Agreed but you can never leave me again"" Brooke sat at Alex""s desk filing through paper work for him, she let her eyes scan all the pages but not really reading them, her mind was on Catie and Jamie. So many things had happened and that was only in the past 24 hours, if and when Catie woke up things were going to get more complicated; Brooke jumped when she heard Alex""s phone ring, she let it ring 3 times before answering it. ""Hello?"" Brooke shook her head when she realized she forgot to state the place she was at, how formal Brooke she thought to herself. ""No he""s not here right now but I""m his assistant if you want to leave a message I""ll make sure I give it to him right away"" Brooke opened Alex""s desk drawer and grabbed a pen and a note pad, she twisted the pen cap off lying it down on the desk and flipped the notepad open to a clear page and got ready to write the message down. ""Okay got the pen and the paper, what""s the message? Catie Roth is awake. Okay th-"" Brooke stopped in the middle of her sentence and read the message over eying the words ""Catie Roth"" and ""awake"" ""Excuse me, did you say Catie Roth was awake? You did? Thanks, I""ll give him the message"" Brooke slammed the phone down and jumped out of the chair she was sitting in pushing the chair back, she ran over to the table where Hank, Tyler and Val were at talking. ""Guys, you""ll never believe this"" Val and Tyler looked up first and then Hank followed their gaze. ""What""s up sis?"" Brooke tried to stop the smile forming on her lips. ""Catie-"" Val listened to Brooke with fear. Oh god, please don""t let her die on me.",29783
327,"Lisette and Nan came soon after I finished. I looked up in surprise at their knocking, and let them in. Nan set about warming the bath water while Lisette sorted through the armoire I hadn""t had the courage to sift through myself. ""G-good morning, um..."" I""d had a bath yesterday, hadn""t I? Lisette was laying out a burgundy colored gown. I cringed, knowing that meant I would be back in the world of restrictive clothing, ""I just took a bath yesterday Nan, and Lisette... do I have to wear those clothes again? Can""t I have something more... flowing?"" Nan shot me a look that shot down my first comment, ""Thing""s run a bit differently for ladies here in the Red Keep, Lady Synne. Besides, I have it on good authority that you""ll be introduced to the King today. Need to look your best, you know."" That had me sweating, but then my savior in the form of Lisette came swooping in, ""Grandma, maybe the light blue dress? That one in the style of the Reach? It has more of an empire waist, to help her ease into more Westerland cloth-"" ""Yes, yes, that""ll do girl,"" Nan bustled back in from the bathroom and ushered me inside. I shot Lisette a smile and mouthed my thanks before Nan shut the tore and practically tore my sleeping shift off me. Soon I was washed, dried, primped and dressed. I was thankful to Lisette; the dress was loads better than yesterdays, tied just under my breasts and flaring out from there without any petticoat. I was pretty sure that if I spun fast enough, the skirt would flare out into a perfect circle. As I went downstairs for what I hoped was breakfast, I saw that nothing was at the table. Florys jumped and darted passed me, finding a larger plush couch to be very comfortable. But I was puzzled. Did noble""s not break their fast until later? As if to answer my thoughts, Tyrion came down the steps behind me, mussing with the fastening of his Hand of the King emblem, ""Blasted thing. My fingers are two fucking big for-"" I knelt down and tossed him a look before plucking the brooch from his hand, sliding the pin side into his vest, and snapping it shut. Then I turned heel and went to scratch a curious Florys. ""... You really are your mother""s daughter,"" He gave a big-bellied laugh but stayed on the stairs, ""She would do the same sorts of things with my fumbling."" My hand froze on Florys""s back. He always spoke fondly about Mother, but usually with a heavy sadness. This was anything but, so I gave him a wide smile of my own and asked, "" Noble""s break their fast?"" ""Usually it is here, but as you see,"" Tyrion gestured to the empty table, ""Today is different. Today we are dining with the King and his sister, Lady Arya Stark, and some members of the small council."" I paled, a thousand thoughts going through my mind. A bastard, dining with the King of Westeros? There had to be some rule against that. And not only the King, but his lady sister and some of the most powerful people in all King""s Landing, if not all Westeros.",748687
1014,"Mira shivered at the feeling of sparks jumping off Laxus"" fingers across her body. Mira didn""t usually date mages, preferring to keep her professional and personal lives separate. But Laxus was converting her. She thought of all the times she hadn""t indulged in her darker fantasies, afraid they would scare off a normal man. She always played the role of sweet, innocent Mira around them. It was part of the reason it never lasted long, she felt she could never fully be herself. But Laxus had never seemed all that interested in sweet Mira. He always chased after her darker side. She smiled at the thought as she decided it was time to bring out her own magic. Laxus felt the electricity in the air before he realized what was going on. A clawed hand shoved him back onto a table. His weight smashed through it and he landed on the ground. He glared before he realized what had happened, then his eyes widened. ""Fuck me, Mira,"" Laxus"" eyes roamed over her new form. Mira gave him her most evil grin as she sauntered toward him. ""That""s what I""m doing, Laxus."" She ripped off his remaining clothing as he chuckled at her response. She straddled him, kissing him again, using her sharpened teeth to nip at his lips. Laxus responded by sending a spark of electricity through Mira""s body, causing her to squirm and arch on top of him. Laxus"" erection began poking at Mira""s entrance, Mira pouted as she removed what remained of her clothing. ""What about foreplay?"" Laxus brought his hand around to her front, his thumb to her clit. He rubbed it hard and sent another spark through her, causing Mira to scream. ""Holy fuck!"" He smirked at the sound, and when she collapsed back onto his chest, still twitching a bit, he took an earlobe into his teeth and breathed into her ear, ""Was that enough foreplay or do you want some more?"" Mira answered by grabbing his dick and impaling herself on it. Both groaned. Laxus couldn""t focus on anything but how wet and tight Mira was, his hands gripped her hips hard enough to leave bruises. Mira bit on her lip to hold in her scream, her fangs causing a trickle of blood. After a moment she began to move, rolling her hips as she moved up and down. It didn""t take long for her to find the right angle so that Laxus hit the right spot inside of her and she picked up the tempo. Laxus knew he wouldn""t last long if she kept this up and he refused to let think Mira think less of him. He tried to flip them, but Mira damn near took off his head when he tried. He groaned as his head fell back against the hard wood floor. His thumb found her clit again, as he refused to finish first at the very least. And he felt when her inner walls began to spasm. Mira""s scream was downright demonic. Mira didn""t even realize that Laxus had finished until after she fell against his chest and felt something wet seeping out of her. She felt like she""d lost her bones as her magic fell away and she became her regular self again. Laxus"" arms wrapped around her. They said nothing for a moment. Eventually, Mira lifted up enough to look Laxus in the eye.",1497577
235,"He pressed his shoulder against it and managed to get it open. Then, he could only stare. It looked as though the last occupant of this place had just had a wild party. There were beer cans and bottles everywhere. The place reeked of alcohol and old food. Furniture had been tipped over in places. The barrier that had made the door hard to open was an overturned recliner. The only thing in here that didn""t look like it had been touched was a shelf full of books. The kitchen was by far the worst room in terms of cleanliness. Blackheart was no neat freak by far, but the smell would kill him if he had to deal with it too much more. It made his breakfast rise in his throat a little bit. Then, a familiar scent caught his nose. The smell of sin was thick around the bedroom. He opened that door. Immediately, he could tell why. The covers on the bed were twisted and half-off the bed. He could detect the scent of the former occupant and four or five different women. He smirked as he wondered if they had all been here in the same night. It took all day to get the disgusting stuff out. There were about five or six trash-bags full of beer bottles and cans and bad food. He left the windows open while he was working so that the place would air out. He was tired by the time he decided to spend one more night at Pam""s and knew this wouldn""t help with work in the morning. Luckily, Pam was too busy to see him come in and he didn""t have to talk to her. Morning, as always, came too soon. He groaned slightly when the alarm on his cell phone, but forced himself to get up anyway. At least he had his new place to look forward to when work was over. It would be nice to have a place to go where he could have some privacy. He got there just as ""rush hour"" as Dawn had affectionately named it started. Waves of zombie-like people who were just as tired as he was came forward. He couldn""t fill the cups fast enough although he was getting better. Linda was working the grill today, so Dawn was running around like crazy taking orders to people. She didn""t seem to feel very good, but she pushed herself anyway. He noticed that she was pale in the face. Then, a familiar scent caught his trained nose. Wafting through the crowds, the scent of sin came to him. When she passed him again, he inhaled deeply and an image came to his mind. He was kneeling to pet Squishie. He realized that he was seeing the world through Dawn""s eyes instead of his own. It felt strange to be in a female body. Then, the two thugs closed in. The familiar fear and recognition of them flooded him. He tried to run, but they captured him. One of them held a knife to her throat, the other one raped her. He was pinned helplessly against the wall as the assailant slammed into him over and over, causing his womb to scream in pain. Tears fell thickly, but he said nothing. It had happened before and it would happen again, he knew. Then, through his own eyes, he saw himself approaching the alley after Squishie had ran off. He saw himself smacking first one in the jaw, then the other just before he blacked out.",870118
263,"The next morning, after they burned Sonoa""s body, and put her ashes in an urn, to be buried in the village of her birth, Shako stood on the steps of the Shrine in front of Kikyo and Keade. He bowed, and gave Kikyo a necklace; a chain of white prayer beads attached to a lavender crystal. ""This I give into your keeping,"" Shako said to the young woman before him. ""To keep pure and holy...to protect. The Shikon no Tama."" Kikyo said no words. She took the Jewel, and concentrated. When she looked at her hand, it seemed like any crystal...but she knew its price. She and her sister watched Shako descend the stairs, and lead his warriors away from their village. AN: I know from the show that it was Songo""s grandfather that gave the Sacred Jewel to Kikyo, but they never said how he knew about her. So I made him Sonoa""s (my OC) older brother. P.S. Thanks to Eien for correctining the name of Songo""s grandfather. I have done my best to go through here and correct it. Ch. 4 A Heavy Burden They started coming almost immediately. The night after the slayers had gone, the first of the monsters had tried to sneak into Kikyo""s own room. It was a serpent that tried to strangle her as she slept. But her sixth sense had awakened her in time to grab her dagger and stab it. It tried to slither away, but he took an arrow from her quiver and stabbed it again, slicing it in two. She never wore the Jewel after that. The following morning, she spoke with the elder monk, and they had a special shrine bult to house the Jewel, a stand in the center of the room held the Jewel, and many of the archer priests surrounded the building. And Kikyo moved her meager belongings to rooms that were much closer to the miniature shrine, that she might also guard it closely. When she was not guarding the Jewel""s shrine, she was going about the village, patrolling the boarders of the village or attending the sick and injured. As she walked about, many who she had known would stare. Men mostly, for they found her desirable. More men, young and old, came seeking her favor during that first year of protecting the Jewel. Most nobles and warriors only did so to try and take the Jewel, but she was too intelligent to fall for their hollow flattery. They cared not for her...only the Shikon no Tama...and they felt not love, but lust. The women of the village, however, were somewhat divided. Some remembered her as the kind, sweet Kikyo they had known or that they remembered with her mother and father, who were kind and respectable people. Other women envied her, saying she was too beautiful, and spread rumors about her that she was a witch and used spells to make herself beautiful, that she hungered for men and that was why she lived in the shrine with so many of them, that she herself wanted the Jewel to use it for her own purposes. And others still simply feared her and never spoke to her. Then, there were the children. The children alone were not afraid of her. They did not run when she drew near, nor did they say hurtful things about her.",512464

1517,"When Edward was inside, Russel looked at Winry, leaning down a little, ""So,"" he asked, ""How""s my girl?"" ""I""m not your girl, Russel,"" she replied as she put her hands behind her back. She hated this part. Around others, he was a gentleman, but ever since he was fourteen, he""d been flirting and when they were sixteen, he""d promised to go to University and come back to marry her. She""d told him over and over she didn""t feel the same. ""You are...You have been since we were kids,"" he said, leaning in more. ""Russel...stop,"" she said sternly as she backed up against the side of the house. ""Why won""t you accept it?"" he asked softly. He wasn""t menacing, but he was assertive. ""Winry...I""ll be graduating next year...I""ve already been interviewed for jobs...I""ve been working odd jobs already..."" he leaned in closer, reaching his arm out to prop on the house, ""Soon I""ll have the money for a proper ring."" ""Russel, no!"" she said, loud enough to make her point, but not so anyone inside could hear. ""I told you four years ago, and I""m telling you again, I don""t want to marry you."" ""But Winry, I-"" She didn""t let him finish. She ducked under his arm, and went to her door. ""I have guests...come in so you don""t catch cold,"" she said, going in. She figured he""d come in, and he did a minute after she did. In that time, she let her eyes look at the small entrance room, then into the kicthen and the dining table in the middle. Alphonse was talking to Flethcer while they ate, and Noah was serving Edward a bowl of stew. How many servings had he had already, though? Winry figured this might be his second...maybe third. Winry hurried over, then took the ladle from Noah, then said, ""Noah, you don""t have to do that...You""re a guest too. Do you need anymore?"" ""No thank you, I""ve had enough,"" Noah said, taking a seat beside Edward...who was already done with his bowl. ""I""ll have some more, please,"" he said, grinning as he handed her his bowl ""Stew hm? It smells wonderful,"" Russel said, having a seat. Winry grabbed another and fixed him some as well, then she got her own bowl and sat down across from Edward...this left her sitting beside Russel, but as long as he behaved, it would be alright. ""So, what are you studying, Russel?"" Edward suddenly asked. ""A mix of science and engineering...I plant to build and design planes and rockets."" ""You like rockets?

""Where did you study? Have you built any...? What are your ideas on the aerodynamics-"" ""I""d rather not talk about it,"" Edward said. Winry looked and noticed Noah was moving hr hand. As the woman""s hand tried to cover Edward""s right hand, he shook it off, then he got up, and walked over to Winry. ""I""m sorry, Winry, I think I""m getting tired..."" ""Oh, um...""Winry had just finished her bowl, so she took Edward""s and hers, put them in the tub for the dirty dishes, then she said, ""Alright, just follow me.",512464
1987,"Blackheart was trying to figure out sleeping arrangements when a love song began to play. Dawn picked Squishie up and started dancing in little circles with her. After Squishie had decided that she""d had enough, Dawn put her down. How she ended up dancing with him, she did not know. She wasn""t even aware of it until his face inched closer and closer to hers. She could feel his breath mingling with hers. The air between them felt charged with electricity. Slowly, his mouth descended upon hers. Instinctively, her arms tightened around him. He returned the pressure. His actions questioned her and she gave him permission to deepen the kiss. Squishie jealously scratched at both their legs, nipping at them to try and get their attention. Ignoring the dog, they broke the kiss. Dark earthen brown eyes met cool, icy blue. ""I think we just ruined our friendship,"" Dawn commented breathlessly. ""You think too much anyway."" He kissed her again, the curiosity and the passion growing. Chapter 8 A/N: It""s been a long time since I updated, I know, but I won""t bore you with the details as to why it took that long. One of the reasons was that I had a terrible case of writer""s block when it came to this story. But Christmas vacation has helped me clear some of that out of the way and I have a new chapter for you guys. Sorry that it took such a crazily long time. I hope you guys didn""t give up on me! It turned out that Blackheart had a very good head for numbers and was needed to run a computer at a computer business. He would be one of the accountants there. It took him a little while to get the hang of the system, but it wasn""t bad. And he didn""t have to interact with very many people. Dawn was at her obstetrics appointment while he was at work. Assuring him that there was no need for him to go, she""d walked the short distance down the road to the doctor""s office. The obstetrician had a private practice, so it was a small building. There were plenty of other women there, some with problems and others, like her, with large bellies. Dawn quietly picked up a magazine after she signed in. I wonder why Daemon seems to be so protective of me, she thought, he hasn""t left my side in a long time. And it""s odd, but I feel like he knows more about me than he lets on. It""s almost like he knew I""d be here. It""s almost like he""s from another world.... There were a lot of things that made him seem like a paranormal being. He seemed to know what she needed before she said. He seemed to possess an otherworldly strength...and those eyes.... She hated to admit it, but he had the most beautiful eyes she""d ever seen. She loved his eyes. They were so icy, but they were...like winter skies. Their friendship had rapidly grown over the months and she was beginning to trust him. She thought of the kiss that they""d shared last night. Without protest, she""d laid down on the couch and wouldn""t go to sleep in his bed. He""d reluctantly gone to his own room. That morning, she""d fried eggs and bacon for both of them and they""d eaten in awkward silence.",870118
176,"Like a song of love that clings to him...how the thought of you...does things to him. Never before...has someone been more...unforgettable...in every way."" TK sang in a low voice, hoping this was as obvious as he had to be. Unfortunately, he failed to see Shiina""s expression of disbelief, and Matsushita""s face, which was turning bright red. At the same time, Iwasawa""s eyes widened, and she stood up, fully taking in what TK had just told him. Her eyes failed to focus on Matsushita. This was all very sudden to her. Iwasawa had always been told she was popular among the student body. Hisako made that clear. However, she had always thought it was only because of her being the lead portion of their band, Girls Dead Monster. She had never imagined a boy feeling...that way about her. All her friends had always been girls, and she thought it would have always stayed that way. ""Well...that""s interesting. I don""t really know what to say though..."" Iwasawa replied, delivering the dreaded answer that Matsushita had hoped he would never hear. TK was speechless now. Shiina remained silent, knowing that the time to act against TK would be soon. Matsushita 5th Dan""s business was none of her""s however. Something inside Matsushita 5th Dan erupted at that moment. His face became sincere, and he pushed past TK. There were no thoughts of judo or of gyūdon in his head right now. No...all he could think of was the beautiful guitarist in front of him and what he was about to ask her. He had decided for himself at this time that he would not lose like this. TK wasn""t going to be there forever. He couldn""t depend on him for everything. Hisako had been right. If he was the right guy for Iwasawa...then there was no chance of failure. ""I""m done with letting him talk for me. I have something to ask you, Iwasawa-san. Something I didn""t think I""d be able to ask you for a long time."" The guitarist was still feeling a little awkward about TK""s words, but from the look on Matsushita""s face, she decided to hear him out. ""Alright..."" ""I...I have always loved your music. Ever since the beginning of the year...when I overhead one of your CD""s with TK, I couldn""t stop thinking about your music. I listened to it every single day, and I still do. In fact...I listen to it during judo training. It helps me focus."" Iwasawa could feel herself calming down as she listened to Matsushita""s words. She knew him only by name, and he had never really stuck out to her much. But now was a little different. He seemed...interesting, all of a sudden. ""I always wanted to know the singer. She sounded so talented. She sang like an angel. I couldn""t help but think about what she was like. I wanted to meet her. I really wanted to just get to know her."" Matsushita continued, his voice becoming more confident with each word. Strangely, this all seemed to come out naturally. He had never imagined being able to say things like this to anyone, let alone a girl. Beside him, TK remained silent, but with a grin on his face. Shiina pretended to look like she wasn""t listening, when in fact she was.",967934

""What is it, Sir?"" Aussie looked so gloomy that everyone can notice that something was wrong. ""C-Clara... she was captured by those... Japanese soldiers!"" He blurted out. Everyone was shocked to hear this. ""Si ate Clara! Nakuha ng mga pangit na yon!"" A child cried. Aussie looked at the child with guilt. Everyone was panicking now. So, he was left with only one choice. ""Everybody quiet! We will retrieve her! So please don""t worry!"" Everyone was filled with hope and cheered. Of course Australia knows it""s kinda impossible. It is Japan with his companions. He is strong with Germany. BACK AT JAPAN""S BASE~ ""Excellent work, minna-san. We all know that Doitsu-san and Italia-kun are doing their part in Europe right now so we have to do our best here."" Kiku told his soldiers. Of course everyone felt rewarded. Kiku smiled and transferred his gaze at Clara. Then, he frowned. She looks desperate and in pain. She also looked at him. He flinched and looked away guiltily. Clara glared at him then looked away. ""Ne, Nihhon-sama. Where will we place this... girl?"" A soldier asked. Kiku looked at the soldier. Thinking of an answer, he transferred his gaze back at Clara. ""Bring her to her room."" He ordered. The soldiers nodded and dragged the poor nation to her own room. As they reached her room, they threw her inside. Because of the force, she fell on the floor when she was thrown. A loud thud was then heard. Clara made a face but didn""t made a sound. The soldiers locked her inside then left. Inside, Clara has a bruise near her chin. She felt tears flowing down her cheeks. She was crying not because of sadness but of anger. ""Damn you, kuya Kiku."" She whispered as she clenched her fists. MONTHS HAD PASSED~ It was a sunny morning in the Philippines. A perfect day for having fun. But of course, it was another dark day for the Filipinos. Not just for them, though. But for everyone in the world. World War 2 is still on. Clara woke up. ""Another fucking day and he is still not here.' Clara thought foggily. Her faith is dying that he would return. That Australia would rescue her too. She merely waits for her day to come. Suddenly, the door opened wide. It was one of the soldiers. ""Nihhon-sama asked for you, Firipinzu-san."" Clara climbed out her bed and went with the servant. As they reached the said destination, Kiku faced her. Clara glared at him. ""What do you want?"" She rudely asked. Kiku frowned. ""You are to respect me, Clara-san."" Clara stared at him. ""He called me by my name?' She thought. She clenched her fists and yelled back. ""Me? Respect you? With your abusing?",2750536
2745,"Every time I had to fight against Kuja, I knew that he really wasn""t an evil person. Just confused, lost, a person who has been blinded by darkness without really knowing it. No matter what Kuja would say to us or what actions he took in order to destroy us, he was never really an evil person. I had vowed early on that I would try my best to save him. When I had found out that Kuja was only to live until I had come of age... I just had to save him; I had to at least save his soul. It didn""t matter what I would have to do. Something inside me kept drawing me towards him. I never really knew why, until the day I left for the Iifa tree. Kuja was waiting for me at the Iifa tree. After we defeated him in battle for the final time, he was the one who had opened a portal for us to escape through. Later, when I had found out that Kuja was at the Iifa tree, waiting for me... I just had to see him. It wasn""t easy finding him. The Iifa tree could equal the size of one of those giant pyramids sometimes found in the deserts, maybe even bigger than that. I left Garnet behind that day so I could find Kuja. As I walked away from the ship that brought me here, I knew that Garnet was looking back, that she would be waiting for my return. Never once did I looked back. The Iifa tree somehow seemed to get bigger as I walked towards it. As it was growing both above and under ground, its branches were everywhere. I looked around for where he could be, and then I found it. The tree had been covering what looked like an underground cave. Kuja should be waiting for me just below these branches. I""ll just slide down them, then. No problem. To my surprise, the cave turned out to be bigger than I had initially thought. As I reached the floor of the cave, I could hardly see the giant braches that had become the cave""s ceiling. Even more amazing was that the bottom of the cave was lit by many countless rainbow-colored lights. Kuja! Kuja, where are you? Kuja! Zidane? I found Kuja lying on the floor of the rainbow-lit cave. As I ran towards him, I could see how much pain he seemed to be in. Something must have happened to him after we left though the portal he had opened for us. Kuja tried to get up, but the pain he was in was too great. It was clear that he had superficial wounds, but... He probably had some type of internal bleeding and broken bones as well. Zidane... I bent down towards Kuja and held him in my arms, careful not to move him around too much. Kuja, what happened to you? It... it doesn""t matter now. I... Kuja was having trouble talking. I""m sorry for what I""ve done. I see now... where I""ve gone wrong. This world... I always thought that the world never wanted me, but it turned out that it was I who never wanted the world. I know I was angry and confused, but now I see... what I did was wrong. All the terrible things I""ve done, I""m sorry for every one of them. Kuja... I... I could only watch as Kuja held onto me, hoping that somehow holding me would release him from his pain. I tried my best to calm him. Its okay, Kuja. Don""t worry, I""m here now.",583994
1036,"He spun around to find himself face to face with Eiko, her floral yellow billowing slightly with the cool wind. ""Eiko. Where are we? The last place I remember being is in Alexandria castle."" Eiko grinned. ""This place is called the Mists of Avalon. You know those visions you""ve been having? Well, whoever is sending them to you wanted you to meet them here. I""m not sure why, though. I know that only a select few in this world have the power to get here. Right now, we""re here using my powers, but I""m not sure how long I can keep us in this world. Man... whoever called you here must have great powers, considering they""ve been calling you for a while, now."" Zidane thought about Eiko""s words. ""The Mists of Avalon, huh? I""m not sure what this place is all about, but I have a feeling that whoever it is that""s callings us here probably doesn""t have much time. Come on, let""s have a look around this place. We""re bound to find whoever it is that""s looking for us, eventually."" Eiko nodded her head. ""Right."" ""Ohhh... the nerve of her! Daring to defy me, Queen Brahm! Ohhh..."" Brahm/General Beatrix paced the lower dungeons. Besides the occasional skittering of some mice, the dungeon was usually pretty quite. The kingdom of Alexandria was usually a peaceful one, so the dungeons were never used that often. ""I cannot believe her! Freeing Akio from my control. Well at least she hasn""t freed Beatrix yet. This body is still of use to me."" Brahm""s wicked laugh echoed throughout the dungeon halls. Brahm/Beatrix smiled as she approached one of the lower cells. ""You better enjoy the time spent with Zidane in Avalon, because the next time you see him, it will be your last."" The silver haired person stirred, before lying still upon the floor once again. Queen Brahm""s laughter was the only sound that could be heard, echoing off of the stone walls. ""Are we there yet?"" Eiko scowled. ""What kind of question is that? You""re the one who has business to take care of here, not me."" Zidane laughed. ""I""m sorry, Eiko. I couldn""t resist. But... how long do you think it""s been, anyways? I mean, does time even pass the same as in our world, in Alexandria castle?"" ""I think time passes faster here. One hour in Avalon would probably translate to almost five minutes in our time."" ""So... how long have we been walking around in this forest?"" Eiko thought about it for a moment before answering. ""I""d say... about 20 minutes. Four hours if you want Avalon time."" ""Has it really been only twenty minutes?"" Eiko stopped, looking at Zidane. ""Didn""t I just say that it""s been almost four hours Avalon time? Sheesh."" With that, Eiko turned her back to Zidane. Zidane hung his head, and turned around. ""Alright, alright already. I get it, I get it. I won""t say anything else about the time."" Eiko smiled and turned around. ""Better. Now, let""s get moving."" Eiko started ahead of Zidane, continued through the mists. Zidane followed her, but muttered under his breath. ""Although I would like to know how you knew just exactly how much time had passed..."" Eiko turned around. ""What was that?"" Zidane jumped.",583994

1472,"His previously rosy cheeks had now become pallid again and he looked at the world with empty, troubled eyes. Esmeralda walked silently beside him. She longed to take him in her arms again, to soothe him and tell him it would be all right. She wanted to punch Joseph in the face for his smug expression and pat Jacques on the shoulder, for he looked guilt-stricken despite having done absolutely nothing wrong. ""In the office,"" the bishop hissed, ""now!"" Reluctantly, they all did as they were told. Just as the bishop was about to say something, Jehan suddenly burst through the door. ""Let him go! He""s done nothing wrong!"" Jehan was talking very fast and he looked half-crazed. ""Jehan,"" Claude said weakly, ""sit down...and please be quiet."" Surprised by the brokenness in his brother""s voice, a shocked Jehan""s butt hit the hard wooden chair with a resounding smack. ""Well, Dom Claude, it would appear you""ve had some success in getting your wayward brother on the right track,"" the bishop commented, ""at least you have that to your name."" Claude swallowed hard and stared at the stone floor. ""I""ve spoken to the others and it seems you""ve had a few successes here...you got an innocent""s name cleared with the help of your ward, taken in two more children, convinced the gypsies to attend the Mass and try to change their ways..."" Claude nearly smiled. The gypsies had heckled him quite a bit during the last sermon he""d given, answering his rhetorical questions with ridiculous answers, but they had at least shown up and enjoyed themselves. The congregation had seemed rather amused... ""But there are a few things that reflect rather unfavorably on you as well,"" the bishop also said, ""Captain Phoebus said that you confessed to stabbing him in the back and Joseph also agrees that this was the case. There was also that little display in the garden just a moment ago. A true priest does not spend so much time alone with a young lady and he certainly has no business touching her the way you did."" Claude""s eyes were closed and he was pinching the bridge of his nose as if to ward off a headache. ""Frankly, Claude, I""m shocked. I""d have thought by now that a man so gifted with your passions would know where to send them...into your sermons, perhaps, your work, your prayers, but certainly not into lust or rage. We can""t have you displaying such instabilities around the others...remember what Paul said-""I will not do that which causes my brother in Christ to stumble"". Do you understand?"" ""Yes sir,"" Claude""s voice was scarcely a whisper. ""Now...I don""t believe you to be beyond redemption and I am willing to give you a second chance on one condition."" Claude""s hands were squeezed together and his shoulders were hunched. He knew, unfortunately, exactly what the bishop was going to say. ""This young woman,"" the bishop said, pointing at Esmeralda, ""however wonderful she is, cannot stay here any longer. You are to have no contact with her from this point on. If you violate that, you must leave the priesthood and you will be exiled from entering Notre Dame for the rest of your life.""",870118
3693,"""By the way, you""re a donkey when you""re drunk!"" she snapped before walking away. Did she just call me an ass? His thoughts suddenly ground to a halt. Wait! She""s talking! She""s insulting me every few seconds, but she""s talking! He chased after her, but she ignored him. ""I see you""re back to being a mute,"" he remarked, ""are you always that pleasant when you speak? If so, I think I prefer your silence!"" She made an indecent gesture that he understood all too well and stomped off. ""STAYNE!"" ""Damn it, not again!"" He sighed deeply. The slight hangover he""d woken up with was turning into a full-blown migraine. He made a mental note to go see Dr. Hathaway for it if he ever got a chance. The day was going so well... Breaking the news to Iracebeth was something he really looked forward to. ""Your Majesty, Um has escaped..."" WHACK! The sound of flesh striking flesh echoed off of the stone tiles. ""...on the bandersnatch..."" WHACK! ""...with the Vorpal Sword..."" WHACK! His face began to register the sting and his already throbbing head was worsening to a sickening pitch. ""How could you let this happen?"" she roared. ""I may have underestimated Alice...but we have her conspirators: the Hatter...and a dormouse..."" He waited to see if she would strike him again. ""OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!"" She stalked off, leaving him there. He sighed and decided that now would be a good time to go get a headache remedy. Aurora was in the hallway. She saw the red mark on his cheek and gave him a questioning look. Why do you put up with that? Her expression said. ""Because I have no choice...you know that."" By the time he reached the hospital wing, the nausea was horrendous. Dr. Hathaway busily mixed up the potion. ""Bad morning, huh?"" Hathaway asked. ""Don""t talk, just stir!"" Stayne demanded. He gulped when the sourness tried to force its way up. Dr. Hathaway gave him a steaming mug. Deciding against asking about the ingredients, he forced down the stuff. Surprisingly, the mist coming off of the mug was from cold, not heat. The minty taste helped considerably. ""It will take about a half-hour to work,"" Hathaway informed him, ""you might want to lay down until it takes effect."" For once, he didn""t object. After he finished downing the cup""s contents, he eased himself back on the bed. ""Thank you,"" he groaned gratefully when a cold cloth was lain over his face. Hathaway smirked when he saw Aurora putting it there. ""You""re welcome,"" he said, trying to disguise the amusement in his voice, ""I""ll just go now...give you some time to rest."" He closed the drapes and walked out. Stayne could still sense a presence, however. After a second, he knew who it was. ""What do you want, Aurora?"" Silence. ""Your selective mutism is getting on my nerves. Either you""re angry with me or you aren""t. If you are, I would appreciate it if you""d go sulk elsewhere."" He heard her get up and leave. There was an odd sense of loss when she did...he almost regretted saying that. With no one around to distract him, he attempted to let his mind slide into unconsciousness. At least there he could escape for a little while.",870118
758,"The thought of being trumped by two possums started gnawing inside his knots and insides and it made him completely ticked and furious about it. Manny saw his face undergoing a angry look and looked completely disgusted. He asked, ""What""s eating you?"" Sid turned quickly and saw Manny was staring him, all weird-like and replied, ""Nothing""s eating me? I mean, why would you ask something like that?"" ""Since this morning, you""ve been kinda creepy-looking and very ticked off. What""s up with that?"" asked Manny. ""There is nothing wrong with me, Manny. I just don""t feel like talking about it."" Manny couldn""t quite comprehend what""s up with Sid, but he had a feeling that it had something to do with being be-throned as ""king of truth-or-dare.' He wanted to tell him about it, but he""s already got enough problems as it is, so it was better for him to keep his mouth shut to keep from aggravating him. He stared at Ellie""s eyes and got completely lost in them, like a sweet shade of beautiful green all around him, in a joyful yet sweet state. He sighed softly as he got really closer to him and then, Ellie stared at him and asked, ""Are you staring at my eyes, Manny?"" ""Yes, I am. They are so.... mesmerizing."" ""Well, take 4 steps back, because you""re starting to creep me out a little bit and you""re too close to my face."" Manny was too close to her face and suddenly backs himself away, looking embarassed and making a fool out of himself. He turned to her and said, ""Sorry about that. It""s just that your eyes are so beautiful."" ""Well, thanks for the compliment, though."" Manny chuckled nervously and starts to have a red spot on his cheeks and Diego turns around to see Manny blushing for the first time. He chuckled softly and asked, ""So, turning on the old charm of blushing, ain""t ya?"" Manny snapped out of it and said, ""No way! I-I wasn""t blushing!"" ""Yes, you were."" Diego said. ""No, I wasn""t."" ""Yes, you were."" ""No, I wasn""t."" ""Yeah, you were."" ""No, I wasn""t."" ""Instant replay, Manny."" Diego mimicked Manny staring at Ellie""s eyes, looking cute and kinda creepy-looking at the same time to make sense and said, ""Oh, Ellie. I can look into your eyes all day long."" ""Okay, I don""t talk like that."" ""Oh, sure you didn""t."" Diego left a mischeivous and sly look in his face, like Manny and Ellie belong together. Manny scoffed and rolled his eyes to deny the fact that they""re really a couple, but it is kinda true though. Diego chuckled and said, ""You dog."" ""Oh, sure. The one thing, you fall for something and the next thing you know, it totally turns into a big game. The big game that a sloth should""ve won, if those ""miscreants"" trumped the king""s crown! That""s total and ungrateful disrespect!"" Sid exclaimed. ""Okay, what is your deal, Sid?"" Diego asked. ""There is no DEAL!!! Why does everyone ask me what is my problem?! There is no problem, got it?!!"" Manny, Crash, Eddie and Diego stared at him like he""s totally crazy and that they never really saw Sid that mad before and Ellie asked him, ""Does this have anything to do with being beat by my brothers at truth-or-dare last night?"" ""No!",1276465
2911,"her hand and placed it on his chest, feeling the beating of his heart soft under her palm. Just one heart, just like he""d said. The Doctor and Donna started to turn around, and Rose quickly turned. ""But it""s still not right!"" she protested. ""Rose, he is me,"" the Doctor reiterated, briefly touching her hand. ""He""s got my mind... he remembers everything we did together, everything that happened after you left... he""s got my quirks and my mannerisms - well, and he might have inherited one or two from Donna, sorry about that! - but what""s most important, he has a human heart. He has feelings I could never have. He can give you things I could never give you."" He was looking at her, a serious look in his eyes. ""And he needs you as I needed you when I first met you,"" he added. ""You can start anew, together, and it will make almost no difference for you."" ""But what about you?"" Rose raised a hand to touch his cheek. ""Ah, I""ll be fine!"" He seemed to want to shrug off the matter, but Rose continued to stroke his cheek. ""You""ll never see me again, and that""s definite this time,"" she said. ""Donna told me that you were mourning me even two years after we were separated. I don""t want you to be sad again."" A soft smile curled his lips, and he reached up to cover her hand on his cheek with his. ""But don""t you see the beauty of this, Rose? I""m giving you the part of me that""s been missing you the most, needing you the most. And since he is a part of me, everything you give him will somehow reach me, too, and it will be enough."" Rose bit her lower lip, looking back at the other Doctor. ""Come here, you two,"" she said eventually. ""I have a question for both of you."" Standing between the two, she looked from one to the other. ""When I was last standing on this beach on the most horrible day of my life, what was the last thing you said to me?"" she asked. The Doctor swallowed. ""I said ""Rose Tyler"","" he answered. ""So how was that sentence going to end?"" Rose demanded to know, her eyes fixed on the Doctor. He slightly shook his head. ""Does it need saying?"" he asked softly. So he still wasn""t able to say it. Rose swallowed and turned to the other. ""Doctor?"" Her voice was trembling. The other Doctor laid a hand on her arm and bowed to her. His lips were almost touching her ear as he whispered his response: ""I was going to say it back."" Rose stared at him for a second, processing what he""d said. Say it back - say what back? What had she said directly before? I love you. It all fell into place. The other Doctor, with the human heart. Able to express feelings, able to feel love, and love her back. With sudden determination, Rose grabbed front of his jacket, pulled him close, and kissed him. After a moment, he responded, cautiously but with utter tenderness, and Rose wrapped her arms firmly around his neck, drew a shuddering breath and allowed the kiss to deepen. And yes, he also felt like the Doctor. A great wave of emotion swept over Rose, and half laughing, half crying, she kept kissing him, and he wrapped her in his arms and kissed her back.",240213

""Hey, Meena."" Morrison called out. When Meena rose her head and faced Morrison, he was blindsided by how crestfallen she had looked and asked, ""Are you okay?"" ""I""m fine.

Then they peeked into the hall, and saw Russel setting up one of the beds from his and his brother""s room for Noah in a room filled with boxes and such, as well as old toys and a wooden crib pushed into a corner. ""Yes...Though, it was more of a large closet after Mum and Dad passed,"" Fletcher said. Then he stepped back, and asked, ""Al, after church tomorrow, would you like to go fishing with Winry and me?"" ""Um...Oka-"" Al started to say, then Ed interjected, ""After Church? Why not go at sun up when there""s better chances of catching something?"" This, Russel heard, and he looked out to the hallway. ""Everyone in our village goes to Morning Mass,"" the elder Tringam sounded a bit displeased, ""Don""t you and your brother go to church on Sunday?"" Al opened his mouth, but Ed answered, ""We""re scientists. We believe in what we can see. You should understand if you""re studying rocket science."" Russel emerged from the room, leaving the bed half competed, ""My chosen profession has nothing to do with my faith."" ""Faith is well and good,"" Ed said, ""But in my experience, I""ve never seen a single shred of evidence to support what most people believe in."" ""Ed,"" Al said, not wanting them to get into a fight. He and Russel stared each other down, and suddenly the taller man smirked, ""Then let""s make a deal...Call it a scientific experiment."" ""What?"" asked Ed. ""I""ve got five weeks left before Fletch and I have to go back to London. That means, counting tomorrow, we""ll have five Sundays before we go. Come with us to Mass for each of those days, and see if it changes your opinion."" Ed thought it over. Then he held out his hand, ""Alright..."" ""Ed,"" Al said. But he was ignored for the moment as the two men shook on it. When they were done, Russel went back to finish helping Noah with her room. However, Al grabbed Ed""s shoulders, and said, ""Um, Fletcher, can you excuse us?"" then he closed the bedroom door, and said, low, but still spastic, ""What do you think you""re doing!?"" ""Come on,"" Ed said, ""The religions here are no different than the ones we""ve seen. All stories and legends, but no scientific proof."" ""But..."" Al said, ""Why do I feel guilty about this? Shouldn""t we have gone just to be nice? Does it have to be a bet?"" ""It wasn""t a bet,"" Ed assured him. ""Besides, I don""t think it will change anything...I mean, don""t you agree, Al?"" he asked. Al looked down, his expression sheepish, as if he didn""t want to admit something. Ed blinked, then said, ""Al...?"" ""...Its just..."" Al said.",512464
2646,"Rose raised a hand to touch his cheek. ""Ah, I""ll be fine!"" He seemed to want to shrug off the matter, but Rose continued to stroke his cheek. ""You""ll never see me again, and that""s definite this time,"" she said. ""Donna told me that you were mourning me even two years after we were separated. I don""t want you to be sad again."" A soft smile curled his lips, and he reached up to cover her hand on his cheek with his. ""But don""t you see the beauty of this, Rose? I""m giving you the part of me that""s been missing you the most, needing you the most. And since he is a part of me, everything you give him will somehow reach me, too, and it will be enough."" Rose bit her lower lip, looking back at the other Doctor. ""Come here, you two,"" she said eventually. ""I have a question for both of you."" Standing between the two, she looked from one to the other. ""When I was last standing on this beach on the most horrible day of my life, what was the last thing you said to me?"" she asked. The Doctor swallowed. ""I said ""Rose Tyler"","" he answered. ""So how was that sentence going to end?"" Rose demanded to know, her eyes fixed on the Doctor. He slightly shook his head. ""Does it need saying?"" he asked softly. So he still wasn""t able to say it. Rose swallowed and turned to the other. ""Doctor?"" Her voice was trembling. The other Doctor laid a hand on her arm and bowed to her. His lips were almost touching her ear as he whispered his response: ""I was going to say it back."" Rose stared at him for a second, processing what he""d said. Say it back - say what back? What had she said directly before? I love you. It all fell into place. The other Doctor, with the human heart. Able to express feelings, able to feel love, and love her back. With sudden determination, Rose grabbed front of his jacket, pulled him close, and kissed him. After a moment, he responded, cautiously but with utter tenderness, and Rose wrapped her arms firmly around his neck, drew a shuddering breath and allowed the kiss to deepen. And yes, he also felt like the Doctor. A great wave of emotion swept over Rose, and half laughing, half crying, she kept kissing him, and he wrapped her in his arms and kissed her back. The sound of the TARDIS leaving made her turn around, just in time to see it fade away. ""No,"" she muttered, letting go of the Doctor and running to the spot where the time machine had stood just a moment before. But it was gone. She stood rooted to the spot until she heard soft footsteps behind her. The Doctor appeared at her side, and without speaking, he reached for her hand, took it and laced his fingers with hers, just like he used to do. She turned to look at him. And the softest of smiles appeared on her face. ""This is brilliant!"" the Doctor exclaimed when they entered Pete""s house. He dashed from one room to the next, admiring the works of art, the paintings, the books, the flowers, everything. Rose hung behind, watching him with a smile on her face. Jackie had gone off to the nursery to look after little Tony. The journey back from Norway had taken longer than they""d thought.",240213
2368,"Sleep. ""Sommeil, Sesel."" Okay, Francis. I guess a little sleep was alright. I can run later, can""t I? ""Bien sûr, ma chérie."" A small smile graced my lips as everything faded, ""Gran mersi."" This place was so big and weird. I had never been to a world meeting before, but France wanted me to come so I did. ""All the nations come, Sesel,"" he had told me. Were there really this many of us? I felt so small next to England and America and everyone else; I hadn""t realized how big and powerful they were. They had always been my friends from World Academy W, after all. ""Attention, attention,"" America called for order, shouting over the voices of others, ""First on today""s agenda is... Uganda, how is it going over there?"" ""Good, sir,"" One of the nations to my right said. I jumped at the voice and turned to see a tall, dark-skinned man with a rather grim expression, ""Last week my people have started to rebuild that had burned down."" Oh right, Uganda. The most recent to recover from the Insanity. ""Okay, then next is-"" ""Why don""t you get your men out of my country, America?"" A man a little ways from me crossed his arms, speaking in a heavy Middle Eastern accent. This threw my friend off for a second but he quickly collected himself, ""Iran, you and I both know I can""t yet. My people have just recently pulled out of Iraq, so-"" ""While you""re over there, my brother and I still need help,"" My head swerved around to see another man, his nameplate identifying him as Haiti, ""Our country, especially mine, is still in rubble America."" ""I know that, but-"" The room erupted into chaos, with nations making demands and talking over one another. I wrapped my arms around myself and looked around for an escape. After quietly excusing myself (quiet enough no one actually heard, most likely), I made my way out of the room into the hall. Once free of the chaos I breathed a sigh of relief, sitting down on a nearby bench and closing my eyes. If being a big nation like that meant I would have to fight and squabble with everyone else then I never wanted to get more land. ""Mon chéri."" My head shot up and brown eyes met blue. France was leaning over in front of me, his blonde hair falling loosely about his face. I smiled a bit, looking away from the bigger nation. ""Why did you leave, Sesel?"" He asked, sitting down next to me and wrapping his arm around my shoulder. I sighed, leaning into his chest and closing my eyes, ""Is it always like this, Francis-nii?"" ""Like what?"" I looked up at him with an eyebrow raised, ""Everyone fighting and stuff."" He just chuckled and shook his head. We sat in silence for a bit and I moved back to lean against the Frenchman. After a few minutes, when the sound from inside the chamber had quieted, the blonde helped me up, ""Let""s go back inside, Sesel."" ""Will they fight more?"" I asked, hesitating before the large double doors. France nodded, ""Probably. You get used to it after a while."" He looked like he wanted to say something else, opening and closing his mouth like a fish.",748687
544,"the Disciplinary Committee Chair complimented, leaving Takaharu speechless as Omiko fumed in shock and surprise beside him. ""Let me see that!"" she commanded, taking the paper without thinking right from Gamagoori""s hand. Most of No-Stars gasped as she made her death wish, but surprisingly, Gamagoori simply allowed her take it. Perhaps it was because he knew what would happen when she did. As Omiko turned it towards her, a blast of vibrant yellow light blinded her as she gazed upon the sheer beauty of Takaharu""s perfect writing. ""Agh, it""s...it""s too much!"" she admitted, her eyes almost burning before she finally threw the paper aside onto the floor, where Gamagoori delicately picked it up a moment later. The Elite Four member shook the dust off from the paper, but surprisingly kept his patience despite Omiko""s indignation. ""You could learn something from this boy, Hakodate. I noticed that your r""s in particular were sloppy. One can only wonder how good your tennis hand could really be if you cannot write a simple r correctly."" he told the twin-tailed girl quite matter-a-factly, leaving her to grumble in annoyance at being called out. ""Sanageyama was right to expect much from you, Fukoroda. Continue to impress me, and I""ll make sure you have a One-Star Uniform."" he told the young boxer, who simply smiled as he stood up again, holding back fierce but happy tears. ""Yes, Gamagoori-sempai! Thank you for your kind words!"" Takaharu replied with gratitude. Meanwhile Omiko just gritted her teeth. She couldn""t believe that all of Takaharu""s sucking up to Ira Gamagoori was actually working. She glared at the boxer in his triumph, her telescropic eye-piece focusing in on him. She was so focused, in fact, that she failed to notice how much pressure she was putting on the pencil in her hand. There was a loud snap as it broke into two pieces, which fell right to her feet. Gamagoori craned his neck up away from the papers upon hearing the noise with his sensitive ears. The moment he saw the pencil pieces on the floor, his eyes almost bulged. Omiko made a nervous grin, shaking in panic as his shadow covered her and her desk completely. Gamagoori than proceeded to bellowed so loud, it would no doubt make a rogue elephant cry. ""HAKODATEEEE!"" From the moment she stepped inside the Athletics clubroom as the very first person to arrive, Omiko Hakodate was sure that this day would be perfect. Now, as she began the long walk home to the No-Star slums, she was beginning to think this day was no longer going so well. It didn""t help that the club registration process took so long, and that Omiko wouldn""t even have a chance to see any prospective members for her club until tomorrow. And things were only made worse by the fact that Omiko had been forced to stay an extra hour to clean up the Athletics club-room, as punishment for breaking her pencil and interrupting Gamagoori""s train of thought. At least that was probably a light punishment compared to what Gamagoori had been known to dish out, she thought.",967934
1250,"5.07: A Kingdom For A Superhero Moirag is angry: Superman has, though more or less by chance, foiled a coup. More precisely, foiled it when she was only an inch away from her goal. She decides to teach Superman a lesson. She starts transforming into Superman every now and then, walks the streets and then ignores both, greetings and cries for help, in order to wreck his reputation. And soon rumor has it in Metropolis that Superman now merely saves those he wants to save. The Man of Steel is not pleased, but soon there are some people demanding that Superman leave the city. Metropolis needs a real hero, a true savior. The ""Daily Planet""s"" competitor, the ""Metropolis Star,"" tops it all off by starting an organized search for a substitute for Superman. And soon Metropolis is teeming with wannabe heroes... This episode reminds a little of the earlier episodes ""Madame Ex"" and ""Vatman,"" where doppelgangers of Lois and Clark, respectively, as well caused quite a fuss. But nevertheless, this episode is worth watching, most of all for the parade of superheroes.5.08: Riddles Special guest stars: Michael Landes (Nick O""Malley), Alexondra Lee (Kate Benson) This is already the third case of sudden loss of sight within one week! The doctors at the Metropolis General Hospital are left clueless. Lois and Clark hear about the matter and want to find out what has caused those strange ailments. A new virus, maybe? But when they want to interview the victims, two Chicago detectives deny them access to them. They introduce themselves as agents of a bureau called ""Special Unit 2"", and they have recently investigated a similar case in Chicago. They have therefore been authorized by the FBI to head the Metropolis investigation as well, but they remain silent about the case. Moreover, one of them, Nick O""Malley, has a strange aversion to Superman and refuses his help. Fortunately, Lois has more luck with Agent Kate Benson. She learns that Special Unit 2 is responsible for ""links"", creatures that originate from the famous missing link between animals and human beings. And one of those links is now apparently plying its dangerous trades in Metropolis: A genuine Greek Sphinx, who takes the eyesight of everyone who cannot solve her riddles... This episode is a crossover with ""Special Unit 2"". The Sphinx already turned up in this show and has now moved to Metropolis. This episode has some very funny moments to offer, for example Nick""s constant hostility towards Superman, whom he thinks to be a link as well. Nick takes some time to understand that not all links are evil. The actor who plays Nick, Michael Landes, used to play Jimmy Olsen during the first ""Superman"" season, before he was replaced by Justin Whalin.5.09: Follow The Green Brick Road Moirag has crafted a new, perfidious plan to get rid of Superman. Employing an old Haitian Voodoo spell, she invokes a magician, who helps her setting a trap for Superman: The Man of Steel is banned into another dimension, which is almost the same as the present.",240213

Mewling like a five day old kitten, she rolled over onto her back exposing her belly. Blossom giggled and treated her to a belly massage too. ""You""re my little spoiled kitty, aren""t you?"" Luna mewed in agreement. Suddenly, chaos erupted from her bathroom and an angry Silver tore through the room with Brick and Fire on his tail. ""Just hold still!"" Fire hissed. ""Never!"" Silver retorted. And so, the two wrestled. Blossom was so surprised, she stopped massaging Luna""s belly. Luna growled low in her throat and leaped down from the desk. Stalking over to the tussling kitties she precisely swiped at both cats with her claws. Both male cats fell on their kitty-cat butts. ""You two..."" she began. ""It""s alright, Luna, Silver""s just not used to being bathed by rough hands- right?"" Blossom picked up the white cat and made a beeline for the bathroom. Brick stopped her though. Honestly, what Blossom saw in Brick, Luna couldn""t fathom. ""What am I supposed to do?"" Blossom gave him a sound peck on the lips. ""Try and win over Luna. She doesn""t seem to trust you much."" With that, Blossom was gone. Brick muttered some curses and Luna felt the same. ""Well..."" he looked pointedly from Luna to Fire. ""She said win you over..."" Luna shivered as Brick""s hands reached for her. While the redheaded hotshot was the perfect owner for Fire, she wasn""t so sure they would mesh right. As he roughly plopped her on the desk again, Luna recounted her life. It was a good one... And then his hands moved to her back. Princess listened to the jabberings of the Persian longhair as it gobbled down smoked Alaskan salmon, spicy tuna, and rare Golden Prince sea bass. ""...and he""s the leader. That guy on that poster, too-"" the cat- who dubbed herself Empress- motioned to the poster of Brick on her walls. ""He was there. The other redhead, I don""t know."" Princess held up a hand.

She was fed up with the cat""s moxie. In came her personal guards with laser guns trained on Empress. The cat bristled. ""Yeesh, you try and get a decent meal around here and this is what happens... She has pink eyes, and was floating in midair. Seemed real chummy with that redheaded boy too."" Princess ground the enamel off he back teeth. Blossom had stolen her cat and her boyfriend too?!

You got to remember I""m not my mother and I will not resort to evil deeds for personal gain! Plus your owner needs you more if she and her friends are constantly attacked by supernatural forces.""

1848,"I sighed, but this time in relief. At least I didn""t have to worry about that now. ""Well...I didn""t see Haruhi today. But I kind of mentioned something important to her when I was with her when I was in that dream place..."" I said; standing up and sounding disappointed. ""I have a feeling you will see her sometime today. She will most definitely make it so."" Itsuki said, before he too stood up. I assumed that without Haruhi being here; the club had no reason to continue today. So, we all said our goodbyes; and left. I walked out of the entrance of North High, my mind swirling from all the information I had received recently. Parallel universes, obscure theories; it all just messed with my head most of the time. I had no idea how Itsuki manages to understand all of it. I almost couldn""t believe the sunset that was beginning to occur behind the school. The sky looked almost painted with an array of orange, pink and red, and the light emanating from the sun looked as if it could almost be unreal. I turned to walk towards home, when I saw the one person I had been looking for all day; only a few feet away. Haruhi Suzumiya was standing there, as if waiting for something. Or perhaps someone. There was only one possible someone for her to be waiting for. She was waiting for me. I knew this was the real world I was currently. God was now waiting for me only a few feet away. My anxiousness would end soon enough. All it took was me approaching her. So, I bucked up my courage, took a big sigh, and called out her name as I walked towards her. ""Haruhi?"" I said, and she faced me with energy I hadn""t seen in awhile. I could see that look in her eyes. The same one that she would have before she was about to announce something completely ridiculous. That look was making me feel better by the second. ""You""re late. There""s a penalty, Kyon."" She said to me, smiling. I couldn""t help but do the same. This was the Haruhi I had missed. ""I didn""t know I was supposed to arrive here at all. I didn""t see you all day."" ""That""s because you slept all day."" ""I""m surprised you didn""t just slam my head on the front of your desk."" I retorted, and Haruhi glared at me; her hands on her hips. ""I was being merciful. Especially since you""re going to be working hard these next few weeks! I""m done fooling around with the SOS Brigade. Things are going to start to get serious!"" she exclaimed back at me. It was then I noticed how close our faces were. The sunset in the background couldn""t have come at a better time. I myself couldn""t help but be mesmerized by the perfection that was Suzumiya-san. I think I had probably been staring at her for a minute or two. I could see she was looking at me like I was crazy; but she couldn""t help but blush at the same time. ""Stop daydreaming about Mikuru-chan! Kyon! Are you even listenin-"" There was only one thing that could have cut off Haruhi""s tirade at this point. It was what I had finally decided to do. A year ago, I would never have done something like this. I would have never even thought about it.",967934
260,"It must had been a lie. ""I-I don""t believe you."" She didn""t know why, but after forcing the words out a single tear trailed down her cheek, her face still hardened with the stubbornness of not showing her weakened state. ""I would not lie to you my dear, I thought you had already known."" The woman""s voice was stricken with apprehension and sorrow, Lunetta stepped up the patio and sat down on the edge of the first step, twirling the twine that was the necklace sharply in her hand, she stared down at the dirt. ""Do you know the story?"" ""I do."" Lunetta glanced back up at the woman, her utterance much less strict and determined, her heart was bleeding out into the island and rising up into the clouds. She felt lost... She needed to know. ""Tell me."" It was a cold night, Marisol had bundled her nude body further into the covers to prevent the cold air from reaching her skin. Her teeth chattered and her back turned to the snoring man... The man, her feigned lover, wasn""t anything special to her, he was a decoy simply for Hoyt""s comfort, not that Hoyt was at all comfortable with his wife being in the arms of another man or in this case bed; he would much rather deal with it than deal with the only woman he ever truly loved getting killed. Marisol rose up from the covers reaching into a drawer of the end table beside her bed. She pulled out the necklace, the wooden totem hanging from its rope. She placed it around her neck and looked back over to the man alongside her in her bed... She didn""t know this man, she didn""t love him, she didn""t want him. She bore a child for him simply because he was her cover, Hoyt""s cover to keep his one and only lover protected, but finally she had decided. She could no longer handle dealing with this, not seeing her true lover alongside her for months upon months, him not being there for the birth of his only child, his only daughter, his only offspring. She had decided that it was time to let him go, for the good of her life and her children""s. Even if the man she slept with now was a pig, who never waited for her pleasure in bed and never kissed her in the morning, she would have to break through all the chains that Hoyt had wrapped her in and relieve herself from him... Forever. Standing up from the bed, she dressed quickly into a bright blue spaghetti strapped dress and left. She walked to Badtown, where she paid a man to take her to South, the night was still young when she arrived, where she would pay another man to drive her to the compound where Hoyt resided. The bright red doors were wide open, beckoning to her, telling her that her new life was soon to begin. She could feel the knot building in her chest. She derived her persistence from one principle, her children. She entered the camp, where bright lights beamed down onto the dirt path surrounding the large mansion that was the heart of the compound. Men had known her well and knew not to mess with her despite her beauty, they reasoned that their heads were not worth losing.",6234395
334,"""How did you guess?"" There was that smile-in-his-voice tone again. ""Well, you are very handsome... and I cannot see you playing the Phantom, so..."" ""Ahh, so you think I""m handsome, jagiya?"" ""I-"" Heat rushed to my cheeks. He was laughing at me, laughing! ""We-well, looks are not everything, you know now!"" ""No... but they help,"" He said with a flirtatious edge, ""Don""t worry; I""ll keep your secret. And yes, I""ll be playing Raoul."" I glanced idly towards my computer and froze. It was 2am. We""d been talking for four hours, ""Wow... please tell me you do not have rehearsal in the morning."" ""Oh, I do."" I jumped up to shut my computer down. We both needed sleep, him for his acting and me... just to sleep. Sleeping was usually a better alternative than facing life awake. At least, when my nights were dreamless, which most of them happily were. And those that weren""t... robbed me of good sleep for days after, ""We need to go to bed!"" I heard a strange noise on the other end. A sort of choking sound, followed by Zen clearing his throat, ""Oh, I guess we do."" ""Well, um... goodnight Zen. Sorry I didn""t play for you, though..."" I looked outside at the subtle tinges of lighter blues on the horizon, ""... probably wasn""t the best plan anyway. I don""t want to be hated by Rika""s former neighbors."" ""Ah, so you are in the same apartment as her""s; Seven thought so,"" I froze, but he went on. Why did I seem to slip up so much around this man? ""Don""t worry, the only one""s who know the address of Rika""s apartment are Seven and V anyway."" ""Oh, um... okay,"" I shifted the phone to my other shoulder and removed my coin skirt. I hadn""t even had the chance to practice. Setting them on my nightstand, I pulled out a plain t-shirt and baggy pajama bottoms, ""Really, we should sleep."" ""We should,"" Zen said, but still neither of us hung up the phone. I pulled back the covers and crawled into bed. Such an odd thing, so speak so much with someone I hardly knew. Especially given my... history. Maybe it was because he had no idea where I actually was, or what I even looked like, that calmed the anxiety. It wasn""t that Zen was bad - I""d only seen evidence of good, if narcissistic, behavior - but that I knew there was no possible chance he could ever hurt me. I was safe. ""You didn""t answer me; do you want to hear some lines?"" He teased, chuckling as I settled down. I rolled my eyes, ""A lullaby, perhaps?"" I didn""t even try and stifle a yawn, giving my go ahead without thinking, ""Sure, Hyun."" ""Ahh, I haven""t heard my birth name spoken in a long while."" ""... are you gonna sing or keep talking?"" He laughed. I was about to give up and just end the call when his melodic voice floated through the speakers. It was low, not the back-seats reaching voice from the YouTube video, but still just... beautiful. Even the slight static and robotic nature of the phone couldn""t put a damper to it. ""No more talk of darkness; forget these wide-eyed fears~"" My eyes slide closed, my usual ignored exhaustion getting the better of me for once. Or it was his voice, I couldn""t tell, ""I""m here, nothing can harm you.",748687
767,"Boron tells the others, ""Keep an eye out. They can be anywhere."" Twilight, Digger, Gylfie and Soren went with them, leaving Travis alone to see if he can use his training methods to use. He grew very nervous about what""s gonna happen next. Then, a tyto pops out of nowhere and slowly creeps on Travis. When he turned around, he sees one tyto coming in, looking menacing. ""You""re back. I see you were with the Guardians of Ga""hoole."" he said. ""And if I was?"" asked Travis. ""We""ve been waiting for you."" Then, he calls out all the bats and they surround Travis, trying to take a piece of him. He groans in pain and kept grunting heavily as ever, but he swallowed his fear and began to fight off the bats and swing his feet to kick them out of him. One by one, the bats flew away, which was a surprise to the tyto. He snarled and said, ""Since when did you become the fighting type?"" ""I""ve been training."" Travis said. ""I see."" They began fighting and beating themselves up. One tyto scratched Travis"" face while he pushed the tyto backwards and lands on the ground. He screams as he runs towards him with a burning branch to kill him. He punches him and shoves him down and Travis dodged every move he made and he smacked him in the face with his feet. ""You""re finished!"" ""Yeah, nice try."" The tyto plans to stick Travis in the burning branch, but he grabs the stick and he stabs the tyto in the stomach. He groaned in pain and lands on the ground, for he was dead. Travis panted heavily and looks at the burning branch, throws it down and said, ""So uncivilized."" He flew off the mountain to find Soren and the rest of the crew, unaware that Kludd was watching him the whole time. He chuckled evilly and said, ""So, you""re back. I am coming for you."" He secretly flew behind him hoping to catch him by surprise. When Travis got there, he sees Soren and the others engaging in battle form. A few tytos emerged out of nowhere and proceeds to fight Travis, but he fought with them one-on-one by kicking, shoving and punching. Soren looks at Travis and sees that he""s taking down all of the tytos all in one. He flies over to help him and fights them as well. Travis was surprised to see Soren fight them and he looked at Travis and asked, ""You all right?"" ""I think so."" Travis said. ""Come on."" Everyone else fought the bats and the other tytos and a war began emerging in St. Aggie""s and Travis is taking the plunge to fight back all the tytos that engaged him in their world in the first place. Twilight and Digger got ahold of some of them while Gylfie and Otulissa battled another half of them in which they all defeated. However, the one still standing is Nyra. She watched them and somehow had to take down most of the Guardians. ""So, you think you can take all of us down?"" asked Nyra. ""We can and we will, because we""re destined to make strong the weak, mend the broken and vanquish evil!"" Soren exclaimed. Nyra laughs deviously and said, ""That is not an option. Because I am sure that your brother will still defeat you."" ""He does not!"" ""And how do you figure?"" ""I know Kludd!",1276465
2051,"We""ll be the people by the big ambulance"" Val smiled sweetly and walked over to the ambulance with Hank and Brooke. ""Good luck guys, hopefully pretty soon this will all be over"" Tyler smiled at Catie and then followed Val, Hank and Brooke over to the ambulance. Catie watched Tyler and the rest of her friends for a second before turning to Jamie. ""Well we better get this over with, I don""t think I can do this later"" Jamie played with the cuff of his leather jacket absently. ""Let""s go Catie, this will all be over soon"" Jamie grabbed Catie""s hand and they walked into the police station. ""So shall we finish our previous conversation?"" Val hopped into the driver side of the ambulance and looked over at Brooke who was sitting in the passenger side. ""Previous conversation?"" Brooke desperately tried to dodge the topic Val was trying to bring up. Val pulled her hair into a ponytail and nudged Brooke. ""You know the conversation about a certain boy and your unrequited feelings for him"" Brooke snapped her head quickly and turned around to face Val. ""God no Val! There are no unrequited feelings between Nick and me! There""s no feelings whatsoever between Nick and me! Nada! Zip! Zilch!"" Val continued to stare her little sister with a look of humor in her eyes. ""Then why did you just freak out when I mentioned feelings between you and him? If there was nothing between you too then you would just laugh it off but no you freaked out, which in my book means there is something going on. Maybe you two just don""t know it yet"" Brooke opened her mouth to say something but instead turned the other way not saying a word. ""Come this way Mr. Waite, Ms. Roth. Oh by the way I""m officer Johnson"" Catie and Jamie followed the officer. ""I""m Jamie, this is Catie."" The officer opened up a door and motioned for Jamie and Catie to go into the office. Jamie walked into the office with Catie shortly behind him and officer Johnson behind her. ""Here is what is going to happen..."" Officer Johnson slammed the door shut and walked over to the desk and picked up a file and scanned the page before putting it back down and facing Jamie and Catie. ""We""re going to have some suspects come in and line up and you are going to identify your attacker out of all of them"" Jamie stared at the window warily as Catie did. ""Can they see us?"" Officer Johnson smiled nicely and shook his head. ""No they can""t. Send them in"" ""How do you think things are going on in there?"" Hank looked up from his shoes and shook his head slowly. ""I have no idea Tyler. I""m just hoping that the guy is actually in there"" Tyler looked over at Hank and bit on his bottom lip. ""What do you mean? You think this is a false alarm? I really don""t think Catie can through this again"" ""It all depends Tyler, I mean maybe they arrested a guy that was similar to the description Jamie gave, it happens all the time. We can only hope this is the real thing, you know Catie has been through enough"" Tyler rested his head against the ambulance and sighed. ""Yeah well sometimes life isn""t fair.""",29783
3173,"""In a day in two they should let you call him. Are you going to eat that?"" Ed sighed and pushed his tray over to the other boy who quickly gobbled up all the leftover food. Once Ling had finally filled his bottomless-pit of a stomach (or, as was more likely, simply exhausted his supply of food) the two picked up their dirty trays and walked them over to the busing station. They had barely made it four steps though, when a voice stopped them. ""Edward Elric."" Though not particularly loud or threatening, the voice had a lot of stopping power, and as soon as it was heard, the cafeteria froze, Ed and Ling included. Ed turned slowly and was unsurprised to see that it was Greed who had spoken. The other teenager was leaning back in his chair, hands tucked casually behind his head as he appraised Ed like a specimen on display in a zoo. ""Yes."" Ed refused to intimidated and met the boy""s gaze with a glower of his own. Greed flipped up his sunglasses, mildly surprised by the lack of a reaction in the other boy. An unnatural quiet had fallen over the cafeteria and Ed could feel a pit of dread unfurling in his stomach. Wherever this conversation was going, he had no doubt it was somewhere he did not want to be. But he would be damned if he backed down, so he squared his shoulders, crossed his arms and faced Greed head-on. Greed hopped up nimbly and walked towards Ed in long, cool strides that demanded attention. ""I read about you in the paper this morning,"" he said, sneer crossing his face. Ed snorted. ""You and half the city. What""s your point?"" ""Ed,"" Ling said warningly, pulling lightly at Ed""s sleeve. Ed yanked it from the other boy""s grasp. Greed watched the little exchange with mild amusement. ""I would listen to your friend, Elric. You should show your betters some respect."" ""Thanks for the tip. If I come across any I""ll be sure to keep it in mind."" Greed threw back his head and laughed. ""Oh, a tough guy."" ""Nope, only an honest one."" Ed would be lying if he said he wasn""t having fun. Every instinct in his body was telling him that he should heed Ling and proceed with caution, but considering his past seventy-two hours, he was overdo to blow off some steam, even if that meant smart mouthing a well-connected juvenile delinquent. Greed continued forward, hesitating a few feet away and began circling Ed slowly. Ed and every casual viewer of animal planet knew exactly what that meant. So much for not fighting, Ed thought to himself as he swiveled, intent on keeping Greed in his sights. ""Such a shame about your mother,"" Greed taunted. Despite himself, Ed tensed up, ready to swing a fist around and punch the smug bastard in the face. ""I suppose you can""t blame her for the way her son turned out,"" Greed paused. ""Then again, rotten stock breeds rotten pups."" Some small part of his brain that wasn""t occupied with seething rage and deciding how best to disembowel Greed, warned Ed that the other boy was baiting him, trying to provoke a response. Needless to say, it was quite quickly and effectively drowned out.",2943978
708,"""Tomorrow,"" Brad answered for Randy. He looked over at Mark, who in turn, looked almost as zoned out as Randy. ""And don""t stay up all night smoking. That souped up fan may get rid of the smell, but it""s also hard to sleep with that thing going all night."" ""Yeah, yeah,"" Mark responded with a small shrug. Brad eventually tugged the blanket from Randy and settled them both down under it, almost immediately falling asleep. Mark stayed up for another hour before putting out his joint and going to bed. Tim and Jill were thrilled to see Randy had come home. To make it more realistic, Randy had snuck out of the house late at night with his luggage, walked a few blocks over, and called a cab to drive him back to the Taylor house. Randy would be arriving in the middle of the night, but he could just blame it on his flight. Brad and Mark had a pretty convincing act pretending to be just as surprised as their parents over Randy""s arrival. The upper two bedrooms had been converted to a study (for Jill) and a guest bedroom, since Brad and Mark had been quite comfortable staying in the basement. Although Randy had been offered the use of the guest bedroom, he had chosen to stay on the basement floor. At least, that""s what he had told his parents. In reality, he was sleeping with Brad. Randy didn""t quite know what he was going to do next, whether he wanted to go back to Costa Rica or stay and get a college degree, in a new career path. Randy was edging on staying, because being separated from Brad wasn""t sitting right with him. The decision on whether Randy wanted to stay or leave was taken out of his hands when Randy had accidently eavesdropped on his parents during a late-night run to the bathroom. Even though his parents had been arguing in the master bedroom, Randy had heard them all the way from the first floor. Randy couldn""t resist sneaking upstairs to find out what was going on. ""... can""t stay here,"" Jill argued. ""What about sending him to live with your brother, Marty?"" ""Marty?"" Tim said. ""Maybe. He does have a spare room in his house, and I""m sure he would help us out once we explain the situation."" Randy snuck closer to his parent""s bedroom door, which was slightly ajar. ""I""ll be happy as long as we separate him and Brad,"" Tim continued. ""Who knows what they get up to down there. Short of installing a security camera in the basement..."" ""No,"" Jill said firmly. ""Don""t even think about it."" ""Well, Brad is leaving for college in a few weeks."" Tim said. ""We could just wait. Then it won""t be a problem."" ""No,"" Jill said. ""I don""t want him living in this house! We tried our best, but apparently there is too much temptation for him here."" ""All right, all right, I""ll call Marty tomorrow,"" Tim responded. Randy didn""t stay to hear more, because he heard one of his parents walking towards the door. He ran back downstairs and flew straight into Brad""s arms. ""Mmffm,"" Brad muttered when he received an armful of Randy. ""What ish..."" Brad slurred his words, before falling back to sleep.",583994
551,"People had been partying for days now without any sleep. Everyone was crashing and Peter being the good friend he was, got rid of all the fucking free loaders and kicked them out of the house. And that is where the story begins. Halloween morning, half an hour before sunrise Edward was feeling like shit. He thought that a weekend long orgy of drink and sex would make him feel any better but it didn""t. He was still sore, now it was physical as well as mental. Jasper was gone and the gaping hole in his heart was still oozing and raw. Miserably, he sat at the breakfast table on Halloween morning and regretted every single thing that happened over the weekend. In fact, he felt like a total slut as he sat before the steaming cup of coffee. He and Peter were sitting in the exact same spot as they""d done three days before Halloween. Edward was much the same except now he was utterly sleep deprived and his ass ached. Peter on the other hand was totally fucked up. Though he""d kicked out all the guests he was still hyper and a rabbit on speed. He was like a race horse on cocaine; pure energy and no way to vent it. Peter was twitching and wiping sweat form his brow as he gulped back an insane amount of coffee. ""Oh Edward,"" breathed while his eyes twitched, ""You wanna do something?"" Edward looked up at Peter like a sad puppy, then looked back down again, ""No."" It was final. Peter shook his head and failed to notice that his shirt was on backwards. He began to babble at a mile a minute, ""Because I can still keep going man. We could go trick or treating tonight, us together. We can get some guns and dress up like rappers or something-or is it rapists?-fuck it we""ll be okay."" ""But I don""t know about you but I did so much cocaine last night and I can""t shake it. I need a big fucking Hershey bar but I can""t leave the house or else you""ll kill yourself and I Can""t break your arms."" Edward looked around the house, littered with beer cans, pizza boxes and used condoms. ""Well Peter if you have energy why don""t you try cleaning up a little."" Peter shot up out of his chair and began to babble more, ""Sure man-clean-up, man-it"" what well do then we can go out and get some more coffee . . ."" And he just kept going on like that. Peter was like a robot, attacking the task of cleaning up the house with efficiency and tirelessness. It was a little disturbing how he cleaned up the used condoms with such enthusiasm but Edward wasn""t one to look a gift horse in the mouth. So the clean-up effort commenced. Edward naturally went to grab a black garbage bag but realized that those were all in the garage. It was dark outside though Edward walked slowly to avoid walking on the Halloween decorations that the guests from the party totally fucked up. As Edward walked in the dark pre-dawn hours, his stomach began to tell him something. Gagging and wrenching, Edward fell to his knees and threw up the large amount of alcohol he""s consumed in the recent time frame. As he knelt on the ground, it felt like he was vomiting his whole life out.",1220273
3360,"as Al drudged up, Alastair gave Al his other hand to shake. ""I""m Edward."" Ed said, ""That""s Al...So, what do we have to do?"" Alastair raised an eyebrow, ""Are you daft?...You""re butchers! You chop up meat,"" he said. It seemed one second they were outside, and the next, they were inside, and looking down at a huge side of beef ribs. ""Well...You chop meat,"" he said, patting Ed""s shoulder. Ed now had an apron on over his clothes and his sleeves rolled up. Alastair didn""t seem to mind the metal arm. ""You,"" the meat monger said to Al, leading him back, ""Are to put the meat in the cooler, or grab some for your brother to chop."" Ed whipped around, then said, ""And what do you do?"" Alastair stuck his thumbs in his apron straps, then said, ""I sell the meat, of course...Now, boys, to work! Show me what you two can do, and I""ll tell you all about your hours and wages."" Then he walked out of the back room, and shut the door that led to the main shop area. Ed and Al stood in the chopping room and freezer area, flabbergasted. ""Brother..."" ""Yeah, Al?"" ""....How do we get into these things?"" Al asked. Ed sighed, head tilting to the left, ""I dunno....But we""d better get started,"" he said, grabbing a cleaver, raising it, then bring it down over the bleeding slab of beef. AN: Sorry for the wait. School and such keeps me from writing. I""ll try and keep this story more up to date. Part Six Ed and Al had to walk for hours to get back to Blackberry after working for six hours in the butcher shop. Al""s complection was as green as the grass while Ed was just tired from lifting the heavy cleaver over and over again, and having to help lug the raw meat. Ed tried for a second to wipe some sweat from his forehead, but heard a loud squeak from his automail arm, and when he raised his other arm to touch his shoulder, her felt a sharp stabbing pain. ""Gah!...Jeez...3 quid an hour isn""t worth this,"" Ed said, letting both arms drop. ""I""m gonna have to fix my own arm..."" ""Winry would kill you,"" Al murmured, then he made a loud groan and covered his mouth. ""I don""t want to eat meat ever again!"" Ed smirked. He was looking forward to dropping dead when they got in. As they came up on the Tringams"" house, the door opened, and out came... ""Um...Winry?"" Ed said, surprised. ""What are you doing here?"" Winry stepped off the landing, and came up to them. She had a basket with three loafs of bread and what looked like a round of cheese. ""Oh, I...I was going to bring these by, but you were both gone."" She suddenly glares up at the door, from which Russel came out. ""But that tom-noddy refused to take me into town to see you. He said you would both be home soon, so I waited."" ""I thought they would be back hours ago,"" Russel said, crossing his arms and leaning on the door frame. ""Don""t blame me for their slacking."" ""SLACKING!?!"" Ed yelled. He made a fist and glared flaming red death at Russel. ""We worked for SIX HOURS in a freezing cold butcher shop chopping up nasty, disgusting, rotting meat!"" As he said this, behind him Al was getting greener and gagging, trying to keep himself from puking.",512464
2854,"Fubuki exclaimed as she felt tears forming in her eyes. Somehow, the word family struck Tatsumaki. It""s been a long time since she last saw their foster parents. Maybe, just maybe, Fubuki was looking for a family to belong to once more. But isn""t she enough family for her sister? This confused the petite esper as she shook her head. ""And you!"" Fubuki snapped at Saitama as she pointed a finger at him. The bald hero pointed at himself, confused. ""Me?"" he muttered. ""We""ve known each other longer than my sister and you considered her as your friend? Whereas you only saw me as an acquaintance? Is it because she""s stronger than me?! Is that it?!"" the raven-haired esper said, her voice cracking. Saitama could only blink. ""Ah. No. It""s actually much deeper than that."" he replied. His real reason for accepting Tatsumaki as his friend is because of her past. He had to consider her as his friend to help the small esper understand the meaning camaraderie. And it""s not all bad being friends with her anyway, he thought. Fubuki gritted her teeth as she turned on her heel and walked towards the door. ""It""s a real freaking treat to be your little sister."" she said before slamming the door shut using a wave of her hand. The two heroes were now left alone, speechless. They simply stared at the door. ""Gee, I kind of felt bad for Fubuki."" Saitama said as he scratched the back of his head. On the other hand, Tatsumaki could only remain speechless. ""Tats?"" the other hero said, making the green-haired esper snap from her thoughts. She looked up at him before staring at the opposite direction. ""I think I need to clear my head for a bit."" she muttered. ""Oh. I""ll be going then."" Saitama said as Tatsumaki nodded and walked towards her living room, not even dismissing the bald hero. Realizing that she was too shaken to see him out, Saitama left Senritsu Tatsumaki""s apartment. ""Sensei, you seem troubled."" Genos said, looking up from his notebook. Saitama then blinked as he glanced at the blond cyborg. ""Ah, was I? I was just thinking about the sale in City C. The supermarket""s located in a popular neighborhood, so it might be difficult to shop tomorrow."" he answered. Of course Saitama already knows what his ""disciple"" would reply. ""Then I shall assist you, sensei! I swear on my grave that I would successfully gather all the necessary items that you would be listing-"" ""Yeah, yeah I get it. You can come along."" Saitama said, interrupting Genos. He really didn""t want the cyborg to get into another monologue. ""It""s an honor, sensei!"" Saitama nodded as a reply before he went back to the manga he was reading. Before he could turn the page, Genos spoke up once again. ""I""ve read yesterday""s paper, and you made news alongside with Tatsumaki-san. Sensei, are the two of you really da-"" ""No, we aren""t."" Genos blinked. He expected that one. ""I see. Shall I incinerate the newspaper company?"" Saitama scratched his head. He had the same reaction as the midget. ""No need to, seriously. The media is always twisting stories so that it would sell, even to the point of creating a whole lie.""",2750536
2446,"Jin""s eyes wandered towards the bluish horns protruding from his head. The other guy stiffened, and Jin felt the tension. ""I mean, they""re pretty cool."" Jin lightly punched him in the arm. ""It makes you look sexier I guess..."" Dio""s pointy ears, for his credit, were red up to the point. Jin looked thoughtful. ""I just said a guy was sexy."" Jin reflected. ""Oh well."" He laughed. Dio muttered something. ""Yeah?"" Jin wanted the guy to feel as much comfortable as possible, and he wanted to listen to what little he had to say. ""Y-you can touch them, if you want."" Dio shyly whispered. ""I-I really won""t mind."" Jin looked skeptical. ""W-well, it""s fine if you don""t want."" Dio looked defensive. ""I-it""s not as if I want you to - EEK!"" Jin""s eyes grew large, while his left hand was slung on Dio""s shoulder, his right arm on top of Dio""s head, holding his right horn. ""That was...kinda girly."" Jin snickered, still not letting go of the horn. ""Your squeak, I mean."" ""S-shut it."" Dio reddened, turning away, though with his horn still in Jin""s grasp, he found it nigh impossible. ""But man, yours is so smooth and long..."" Jin stroked Dio""s up and down. ""It""s quite hard too..."" Jin grinned when he noticed Dio smiling slightly, even when the guy was blushing not-so furiously. ""Can I touch your ears too?"" Jin felt embarrassed at the request. ""I mean, we have Lire and Ryan but it""s weird asking to touch Lire""s ears, and Ryan""s very...sensitive about his ears."" Dio looked shell-shocked at that one. Jin immediately took back what he said. ""Weeeeell, that was just me being weird. Please forget what I said."" ""No..."" Dio tucked his hair behind his ear. ""It""s okay..."" Jin tentatively slid a finger along the base up to the end, marveling at how it twitched when he touched it. His hand stroked it from down up, and rubbed it between his thumb and index finger. Dio mewled softly, and shivered, closing his eyes. ""God, Dio."" Jin swallowed a thick gob of his spit. ""You""re like a walking sex god, you know that?"" ""Wait-what?"" Dio growled immediately. ""Ah sht!"" Jin covered his mouth. ""No, that didn""t come out right! I mean..."" Dio patiently waited, glaring at the boy. ""How can you be so fcking cute and...sexy at the same time?"" Jin looked away, with a severe blush in his face. ""Oh god...I think I""m gay for you or something..."" Jin didn""t have time to properly react when he found his hand drawn close before lips crashed into his own. An obtrusive tongue sought permission to enter him, and abandoning his doubts for a second, had found his tongue participating in a lock that felt rough, alive, wet and quite sloppy.",583064
3090,"But he barely had time to even so much as beg for forgiveness, before Gamagoori let loose the heavy barbed vines from his Two-Star Uniform, hitting the No-Star with the force of a mach-truck and sending him rocketing away over the horizon. ""Let that be a lesson to you all."" Gamagoori stated to all the terrified No-Stars. ""Those who second-guess the alphabetical structure of Satsuki Kiryuin""s name will be severely punished."" With that, Gamagoori was silent as he continued to survey the rest of the club registration forms. All seemed well as he continued, until he suddenly stopped as his eyes focused on one paper in particular. Takaharu became fidgety all of sudden, as a bead of sweat came down his brow once he realized it was one of his papers that Gamagoori had stopped to look at it. ""FUKORODA! TAKAHARU FUKORADA!"" Gamagoori shouted, and as expected, the crowd split to reveal Takaharu. Even Omiko skidded her desk to the side just a bit, hoping that if the boy was hit, she wouldn""t be caught in the crossfire. But despite Gamagoori""s terrifying presence, Takaharu tried his best to remain unafraid. ""H-Here, Gamagoori-sempai! I am sorry for whatever error I made! Deeply, utterly sorry!"" he said apologetically, his voice cracking slightly as he tried to hold back his fear. But Gamagoori did not proceed to hit him as Omiko had expected, and instead lowered his voice as he addressed Takaharu is earnest. ""You can calm yourself. I was just noticing your work, Fukoroda. I can truly see the boxer""s hand in this beautiful script. Very impressive."" the Disciplinary Committee Chair complimented, leaving Takaharu speechless as Omiko fumed in shock and surprise beside him. ""Let me see that!"" she commanded, taking the paper without thinking right from Gamagoori""s hand. Most of No-Stars gasped as she made her death wish, but surprisingly, Gamagoori simply allowed her take it. Perhaps it was because he knew what would happen when she did. As Omiko turned it towards her, a blast of vibrant yellow light blinded her as she gazed upon the sheer beauty of Takaharu""s perfect writing. ""Agh, it""s...it""s too much!"" she admitted, her eyes almost burning before she finally threw the paper aside onto the floor, where Gamagoori delicately picked it up a moment later. The Elite Four member shook the dust off from the paper, but surprisingly kept his patience despite Omiko""s indignation. ""You could learn something from this boy, Hakodate. I noticed that your r""s in particular were sloppy. One can only wonder how good your tennis hand could really be if you cannot write a simple r correctly."" he told the twin-tailed girl quite matter-a-factly, leaving her to grumble in annoyance at being called out. ""Sanageyama was right to expect much from you, Fukoroda. Continue to impress me, and I""ll make sure you have a One-Star Uniform."" he told the young boxer, who simply smiled as he stood up again, holding back fierce but happy tears. ""Yes, Gamagoori-sempai! Thank you for your kind words!"" Takaharu replied with gratitude. Meanwhile Omiko just gritted her teeth.",967934
1571,"Still, it would""ve been best if... ""Everyone...gather around..."" The cleric called on his apprentices. ""I want all of you to never speak of this matter outside the church. I will not hesitate to silence all of you if need be. There should be no circulating news about what had happened this day."" The acolytes nodded, realizing that they would be denied priest hood if they had ever said word about it. ""Good."" The cleric looked at everyone. ""I assume all of you are very tired by now. Please, go back to your quarters and rest. We will resume training by tomorrow. That is all. ""The cleric made final word. After a short prayer, the hall cleared up of its residents, as the only persons left were the cleric and the resting acolyte in his arms.

""Am I too late? How is the boy?"" The just-arrived priest asked the other. ""He is well, he had an encounter..."" ""From what?"" ""It is best if we rest for now. I will tell all the details of what happened in the refectory, while we will have our breakfast. In the meantime, I suggest we keep an eye out for this boy. I feel he is somewhat special...""
