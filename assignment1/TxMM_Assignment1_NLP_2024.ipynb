They are not so great for production-level systems, e.g. when you work for a company and are tasked with designing a component to perform some textual analytics task. For these purposes, scripts should be used. In later assignments, we'll also use those, but for now, notebooks are ideal. With growing experience, you'll get a feeling for when each tool is appropriate.\n",

Another possibility is that the file contains a character that for some reason is not handled correctly on your computer. This doesn't happen often, but you can check at which tweet your load_data function stopped parsing and manually inspect the tweet to remove/alter the character.\n",

        "**Q: I think I did a task correctly, but the assert tells me I don't have the correct number of tweets left, what am I doing wrong?** \\\\\n",

        "\n",
        "**Q: I have strange bugs in the base code you provided, what do I do?** \\\\\n",

All our code has been implemented and tested using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), because this is relatively hassle-free. Please consider switching in case you experience such problems. We can try to help you out on other platforms, but cannot guarantee that we can solve it.
